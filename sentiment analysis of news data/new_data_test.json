[{"content": "We are in war. We're all in shock. The case is not for less. No one, especially in the Western world, lived a situation of these. I have already written here many times, which we live in a global world. In this global village that allows us to be quickly connected with Australia or Canada, which allows us to do business with any point in the globe, also returns us as this virus whose spread began in China. Yes, this is also globalization.\nWe are facing an unprecedented crisis because the most recent epidemics remained more geographically concentrated. The 2008 crisis, for example, was neither closely nor by far, similar to this. It was mainly financial, and economical. We had social consequences, but without public health problems we are witnessing and we will have ahead.\nIt is not by chance that at Christmas the most common message is health desire. It is that this good, this gift is, without a doubt, the greatest we can have. Even to meet financial and economic crises. We are at a stage, in which circumstances and risks, almost lead us to say: that the economy is shaped, which shakes the orthodoxy of certain decision-makers. Which one leaves. I think there is no business that is superior to the value of human life. Only we can not sand the economy. We have today to take care of everyone to restore the economy.\nLet's be clear. No one has conditions to face, by themselves, to a pandemic of these. There are no resources. There are no means. Portugal is not an exception. And Portugal had already had, before Covid-19, many problems in our National Health Service (SNS). We are not prepared, not too much or less to test the SNS response peak, fans, machines, do not multiply, much less health professionals, whose shoulders will carry weights that will test their limits, such as China and Italy have already shown us.\nHowever, we are not prepared can not mean crossing arms, waiting for danger. We can not. For exceptional periods, responses must be exceptional. Yes, we need to be home. Yes, we need to realize that this is not for jokes, to go to the beach or simply ignore the severity of the problem of the contagion facility. In life in society, the unconsciousness can, in literal sense, to dare the lives of others, especially those of the most vulnerable.\nTherefore we need strong leadership and authority. We can not play rulers, do not just make a stage pose. We need fiber and pulse people to make difficult, unpopular but necessary decisions. We do not need politiquices. We can not get hostages of seemingly technical opinions, since in these public health measures the technician becomes inseparable from the politician. Italy is a dramatic example. It's there. To observe, learn and correct answers.\nAnd this is also a defining moment. Where is the European Union? What response gives? Years and years of European construction, bureaucratic institutions and when we have a global problem, it is each by itself. This is what feels, very little cooperation and solidarity. And this will have economic and political consequences there further. But there we want to be all alive. Also to evaluate the answers that our policy makers gave us, this time will arrive to take the swing, to make the evaluations, but after the fire becomes ashes. Lives to rebuild a world that is all connected and that shows us that there is no one immune in such a situation. Rich and poor, western and east. We are all in the same boat, humanity, just like the planet where we inhabit, is one.\nI think there is no greater fear than that of death or to see our perish. And this should be our focus. Then, with health, with all patients treated, we must rebuild a global economy. We still can not count the havocs for two weeks at home, still for more when we do not even know if it's going to be just 15 days or more. It will be dramatic for commerce, restoration, hospitality and other services. Yes. Unfortunately it will be. The tourism sector is of tracks with cancellations. Many factories will have to stop or labor quite below their ability. But we urgently need to static this bug to return to the Esplanadas, restaurants, shopping centers and beaches. Without vaccine, without effective anti-virus in the elimination of Covid-19 remaining, as they called them the epidemiologist Peter Piot (one of the researchers who discovered Ebola), \"medieval methods of containment: insulation, quarantine and mapping of contacts\".\nThat is grown the economy, people's safety is first. It takes courage. "}, {"content": "POLL-Chinese economy clobbered by coronavirus but set to recover soon. (Reuters) - The coronavirus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.\nA Feb. 7-13 Reuters poll of 40 economists based in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, as well as Europe and the United States, predicted China\u2019s annual economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 to slump to 4.5% from 6.0% in the previous quarter.\nThat drop was expected to drag down the full-year growth rate in 2020 to 5.5% from 6.1% in 2019, its weakest since at least 1990 when comparable records began.\nHowever, economists were optimistic the economy would bounce back as soon as the second quarter, with growth then forecast to recover to a median 5.7%, according to the poll.\nThat figure was pushed higher by several optimistic forecasts from economists based in mainland China. The range was 2.9%-6.5%.\nThe coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan - a nerve center in the global supply chain with a population of just under 11 million - and so far has claimed over 1,300 lives in China. That outstrips fatalities from the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 which killed 774 people worldwide.\n\u201cNobody knows the damage China\u2019s virus containment efforts will have on growth, and we probably never will for sure, given the opacity of the statistics. We reckon true GDP growth will fall below 2% in Q1, from 4.0% in Q4, which already was substantially lower than the official 6.0%,\u201d said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon in London.\n\u201cThe lost production probably will be made up over the remainder of this year. But some service sector activity simply will be lost... people aren\u2019t going to get their hair cut twice because they missed getting it cut in Q1, or buy two coffees to make up for missed consumption.\u201d\n(Reuters poll graphic on coronavirus impact on the Chinese economy - here)\nThe enforced shutdown started during the Lunar New Year - usually the busiest time for most services businesses and according to most economists will accelerate an already-noticeable downturn before the outbreak.\nWhen asked to comment on what would happen to the economy if Chinese authorities failed to contain the virus from spreading rapidly, some mainland economists were reluctant to respond.\nGrowth was expected to slow to 3.5% in the first quarter in a worst-case scenario, according to a median from 15 economists in response to a separate question, with forecasts ranging between zero and 5.5%.\n\u201cI think the virus will be under control by April. However, in the worst-case scenario, growth may fall to 2-3% in the first quarter and to 5% in (full-year) 2020,\u201d said Bingnan Ye, senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of China International in Beijing.\nTheir 2020 forecast matched the median worst-case outcome and lined up with the Chinese government\u2019s forecast for the full-year economic growth rate to fall as much as 1 percentage point in 2020.\n\u201cWe do not expect a speedy recovery for the economy, even in the unlikely event that there are no new confirmed cases. After the coronavirus has been contained, it may still take four quarters to see a full recovery,\u201d said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.\n\u201cCompared to 2003\u2019s SARS, this is a lot more damaging.\u201d\nSince then, China\u2019s economic composition has changed significantly to become a more consumption and service-driven economy from being the world\u2019s factory before.\nChina\u2019s share of the global economy has quadrupled to 16% since the SARS outbreak, so any major disruption to economic activity is likely to have a bigger impact on the world economy now.\n\u201cEvery day is a deadline in February as Wuhan coronavirus data roll in,\u201d noted Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, the most accurate forecaster for Asian currencies in 2019. \u201cFor the yuan, the overall depreciation story continues.\u201d\n(Reuters poll graphic on China economic outlook - here) "}, {"content": "Coronavirus.

"}, {"content": "Combatting corona: Why govt needs your help to contain virus. Over 6,000 people have died globally since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. More than 1,62,000 have been infected by Covid-19. What started in China, soon spread across France, the US, Spain, Italy, South Korea and now India.\nIndia, so far, has officially reported 110 cases and two deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. More cases are emerging every day even as states continue to issue advisories on social distancing.\nThe government has put in place stringent measures to curb the spread of the virus. A mandatory quarantine of 14 days has been initiated for all international travellers arriving in the country.\nFrom thermal screenings at major entry-exit points to sanitisation of public places, the Indian government has put its best foot forward in battling the pandemic which has led to significant panic among Indians.\nSelf-discipline is the best cure\nHowever, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, the utmost requirement at the moment is self-discipline.\nWith the threat of the rapidly spreading virus looming large over India due to its billion-plus population, it is important to understand the depravity that could be if the spread is not limited in the initial days.\nItaly is the best example to map how rapidly the virus can spread and why it is absolutely essential to impose self-restrictions at an early stage, and not wait for the disaster to strike.\nThe country recorded 368 more deaths from the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, its biggest single-day rise, amid growing concern about the ability of its strained health system to cope with the relentless increase in new cases. With 24,747 cases and 1,809 deaths by Sunday - a rise of 368 or 25 per cent in the death toll in just 24 hours - Italy's experience has offered an alarming example for other European countries. And, Indians should take note.\nThe daily rise in cases around the globe, especially in countries like Italy -- with a small population of 60 million people -- is alarming. If the virus spreads with such aggressiveness in India, it could result in severe consequences even after the virus fades away.\nIn Italy, hospitals are also unable to cope with such high-frequency rise on a daily basis. Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna called the situation 'war-like', as reported by The Guardian.\n\"It's an experience I would compare to a world war, but it's a war that isn't fightable with traditional arms - as we don't yet know who the enemy is and so it's difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off,\" she said.\nPrecaution, not panic\nWith an abundance of global examples that show the severe spread of Covid-19, it can be deduced that most infections spread through lack of individual restrictions at an initial stage. And as the situation aggravated with rising cases in a country or one particular area , the excessive panic was witnessed.\nThis panic, if substituted by precautions at early stages, could help India avoid the health crisis of a much larger magnitude. However, the government alone would not be able to help limit the virus; all citizens must also act responsibly and take the outbreak seriously.\nSocial media chatter over the past few months since the outbreak has often misled people, as some took it lightly and others panicked to insanity. However, doctors advised none of the above. Instead, they asked people to be prepared with some basic but necessary precautions. Social distancing, however, is the most important one.\nThree ways that you can help\n1) Doctors have asked people to stay home if they absolutely do not have to go out.\n2) Medical experts have also asked people to avoid any kind of large gatherings.\n3) Take care of hygiene, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your face\nThese are a few simple steps you can take to support the government in limiting the spread of Covid-19. While not much is known about this virus, doctors, have asked people to follow these important steps at the moment to delay the spread of the virus. But even if you test positive, there is no need to suppress your travel history or run away.\nThe quarantine process is not only for the recovery of an infected person but it is also for the safety of other people in the country. Going by the rate of spread in Italy, Iran, and China, any person with symptoms coming in contact with other people could prove deadly as the virus would keep multiplying. Even if it does not affect an individual carrying it, doctors have clearly mentioned that its spread could be fatal for older people with a weak immune system.\nFor instance, one of the first cases in Uttar Pradesh's Noida which led to an initial shut down of two schools and a five-star hotel, was from a man who returned from Italy and kept his travel history suppressed. He then kept on with his usual social life, exposing others to the danger.\nThere are many other reports in India about suspected people running away in fear that they would be kept in isolation in the quarantine facility. But people have to realise that the process will help in containing the spread of the virus to a great extent.\nIndia is still in the initial stages with 110 official confirmed cases, and so far, it has managed to keep the death toll much lower than the other countries in the third week of the outbreak. And, by imposing self-restrictions, individuals can help the government in flattening the curve further.\nPeople on social media, especially, the young batch who are yet to grasp the seriousness of the issue, need to be more self vigilant. The basics include - doctor visit for 'flu-like symptoms', avoiding crowded places and social gathering until absolutely necessary, restricting movement, opting for work-from-home. It is important to realise that every country initially had a mere number of cases, but within days it rose massively.\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, and at this hour, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, it is imperative to focus on personal hygiene and self-discipline.

NEW YORK: Drug manufacturers\u00a0racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go. \n That runs counter to reports of a supposed \"breakthrough\" that on Wednesday (Feb 5) boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality. \n At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading contagion. \n Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as US$800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort. \n  \n \"It will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit,\" said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's vaccine unit. GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent. \n The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm. \n To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment. \n \"There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey. \n Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged. \n Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola. \n 'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET' \n Dr\u00a0Thomas Frieden, who was director of the US\u00a0Centres for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest. \n What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm. \n \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,\" Frieden said. \n A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus , while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine. \n Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets. \n \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,\" said World Health Organisation spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \"drug breakthroughs.\" \n Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months. \n Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by Moderna Inc, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus. \n Anthony Fauci, director of the US\u00a0National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate. \n He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus. \n Novavax Inc research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus. \n But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. \n In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population. \n \"The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" Fauci said. \n Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question. \n \"The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note. \n The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around US$800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, Moderna Inc and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines. \n \"We stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's chief scientific officer. \"We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\" \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram "}, {"content": "Coronavirus: India Inc will shiver if China can't contain outbreak . Growing insecurity over the coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in China may have a sharp impact on India's already-strained economy as industries fear that the outbreak could cripple their production activities.\nA recent report by Ind-RA said efforts to contain the virus outbreak within next three to four months will be critical as it would determine the fate of many industries around the globe, including in India.\nIf the virus is contained within the aforesaid time period, the impact on businesses in India and elsewhere will not be overgenerous, the report said.\nBut if no positive result comes within a few months, multiple Indian sectors could face major supply-side disturbances, triggering a delay in key manufacturing activities.\nThe Ind-Ra report goes on to highlight that the economic impact could be worse than what was seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003. At that time, the world was less dependent on China, now considered the biggest world's biggest manufacturing hub with a substantial contribution to the global GDP.\nChina now contributes to over one-sixth or over 15 per cent of the world's GDP and any deceleration in manufacturing activity could significantly impact worldwide growth.\nCommenting on the situation, Sunil Damania, CIO, MarketsMojo.com, said, \"For some reason, if China is unable to control it for six months, the impacts would be severe.\"\n\"It's very difficult to quantify as there are many moving parts. But it would have a significant impact and has the potential to drag down the world's GDP growth rate by at least 20 basis points for CY2020,\" he added.\nIMPACT ON INDIA\nThe Indian economy is already battling many headwinds including inflation, slow demand, and lower-income, which resulted in a sharp fall in GDP growth in 2019. Economic woes could amplify as many of the country's key sectors rely heavily on components or parts manufactured in China.\nWhile the government predicted India's growth for the next fiscal at 6.5 per cent, delay in supply of key essential commodities from China for a prolonged period could spill water on that optimistic forecast.\nSome sectors such as automobiles, consumer electronics, drugs and pharmaceuticals -- all of which contribute significantly to the country's GDP -- will bear the brunt of the supply curbs. Interlinked sectors will also suffer as a result.\n\"If the outbreak continues for longer than anticipated then the risk will not be restricted to a few sectors, but it can hurt the overall economy,\" Damania said.\nOver the past few weeks, concerned voices from the industry have discussed the issue in detail.\nSome industry experts said trade has already been mildly affected in India as supply chain issues start cropping up. The impact will start showing when firms run out of inventory, they said.\nLOWER JOBS, INFLATION AND MORE\nA delay in the supply of inventory would not only lead to lower production but will also lower sales volume. It could also lead to job cuts and higher inflation.\nFor instance , many electronic goods and phone manufacturers have already started facing the effects of supply slowdown as companies in China failed to restart key manufacturing activities. Major smartphone sellers like Xiaomi hinted at possible rise in prices as supplies of key components are already facing delays.\nA host of Indian smartphone manufacturers, who dearly depend on China for key components, are already indicating that their productions will fall if the supply disruptions continue. It could be a huge blow to India, which is the second-largest smartphone market in the world.\nSome analysts are expecting a drop in production and sales of consumer durables and smartphones while others fear that prices could go up in a situation where there is high demand but lack of supply.\nConsumer durables like television, washing machines and air conditioners -- all of which need critical components manufactured in China -- may also see a drop in sales due to lack of supply.\nWhat's worse is the fact that it could lead to higher inflationary pressure on India as China vendors have hiked prices of critical components amid the shortage. Higher inflation in times of slow growth could be disastrous for India and could severely disrupt plans to revive the economy.\nLike smartphones, automobile manufacturers also import a host of parts and essential components from China. It may be noted that more than 60 per cent of Chinese auto assembly production units have been directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic.\nA Boston Consulting Group report said the impact on the Chinese automobile industry will affect many other countries including India. A Fitch report said India's auto production activity could dip by over 8 per cent in 2020 due to the situation.\n\"China supplies India with between 10-30 per cent of its automotive components and this could be two to three times higher when looking at India's EV segment, which highlights just how exposed India's automobile manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle Chinese component manufacturing,\" it said.\nBut manufacturers in India have little choice apart from monitoring the situation and hoping for factories in China to fire up their assembly lines. Some Chinese factories reopened this week, but workers are in no position to resume activities with no solution in sight.\nAnother concern that India could face due to the virus outbreak in China is job cuts. With lower scope of production activities, some companies will be forced to lay off contractual labourers.\nThis could have a negative effect on India's declining income levels.\nLower manufacturing and production activity due to the virus outbreak could pull down India's Industrial output, which is also not in good shape. To sum it up, a fall in manufacturing output along with ticking inflation and supply constraints could worsen India's growth outlook further.\nAt the time of writing this article, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak stood at 1,488 with a sharp jump in the number of confirmed cases at over 65,000.\nThe situation in China remains critical with 121 news deaths on Friday while Japan registered its first death, the third fatality outside China.

SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. \n While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. \n CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY \n There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. \n In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. \n SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. \n Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. \n The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. \n In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. \n Studies done many years ago showed that the \u201cregular\u201d coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. \n More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity. \n  \n The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is \u201cintensive use of air-conditioning\u201d. \n Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. \n LESSONS FROM SARS \n The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters"}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak causes \"severe impact\" in the operations of European companies in China.

The death toll in China's novel coronavirus outbreak on Friday climbed to 213 with the number of confirmed cases totalling to 9,692.\nThe WHO said there had been 98 cases in 18 other countries, but no deaths. Most international cases are in people who had been to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic.\n\"We are still at a very critical stage in fighting the coronavirus. International solidarity is extremely important and for that purpose all countries should behave in an appropriate and responsible manner, China\u2019s Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun said on Thursday.\nSpeaking to reporters here, Jun said while Beijing understands the concerns of other countries over the outbreak, \"we should also listen to the advice\" of the Director General of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who has said that he \"has full confidence in China\u2019s efforts to combat the outbreak.\nJun said that \"there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade\" and the WHO doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement.\nThe Chinese envoy added that under the current circumstances, the world needs solidarity in combating the outbreak. He stressed that all countries should adopt a responsible attitude, work together to combat the virus, and avoid \"overreaction that may result in spillover negative effects.\nHe also added that we are still making our assessment of the WHO declaration.\nWHO\u2019s Emergency Committee, declaring the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency, called on all countries to take urgent measures to contain the respiratory disease.\nThe main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China, but what is happening in other countries,\" said the WHO chief, praising the \"extraordinary measures\" taken there by authorities.\nChina quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence, so that other countries could diagnose it quickly and protect themselves, which has resulted in rapid diagnostic tools,\" said the statement from the Committee.\nAccording to a press release issued by the Chinese Mission to the UN, Jun reiterated that the WHO DG clearly stated that the main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but about protecting countries with weaker health systems and which are ill-prepared to deal with potential spread.\nHe said WHO continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak and the Director-General's recommendations should be seriously considered.\nThe US issued a 'Do Not Travel' advisory for China due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\"Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. On January 30, the World Health Organisation has determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

Disposable rubber gloves are indispensable in the global fight against the new coronavirus, yet a month\u2019s lockdown in stricken Malaysia where three of every five gloves are made has upended the supply chain and threatens to hamstring hospitals worldwide.\nThe world\u2019s biggest maker of medical gloves by volume, Top Glove Corp Bhd (TPGC.KL), has the capacity to make 200 million gloves a day, but a supplier shutdown has left it with only two weeks\u2019 worth of boxes to ship them in, its founder told Reuters.\nWe can\u2019t get our gloves to hospitals without cartons, Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai said in an interview. Hospitals need our gloves. We can\u2019t just supply 50% of their requirement.\nThe virus, which emerged in China at the end of last year, has left Malaysia with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at nearly 1,800 cases, with 17 deaths. To halt transmission, the government has ordered people to stay home from March 18 to April 14.\nGlove makers and others eligible for exemption can operate half-staffed provided they meet strict safety conditions. Still, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) said it was lobbying almost every hour to return the industry to full strength to minimize risk to the global fight.\nWe\u2019re shut down, said Evonna Lim, managing director at packaging supplier Etheos Imprint Technology. We fall under an exempted category but still need approval.\nDr Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at the New York University School of Medicine, said she was using up to six times as many gloves as normal each day due to the number of patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\nIf we get to the point where there is a shortage of gloves, that\u2019s going to be a huge problem because then we cannot draw blood safely, we cannot do many medical procedures safely.\nGLOBAL CALL\nWith glove supplies dwindling, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on its website this month said here some gloves could be used beyond their designated shelf life. On Tuesday, the United States lifted a ban on imports from Malaysian glove maker WRP Asia Pacific who it had previously accused of using forced labor.\nBritain\u2019s Department of Health & Social Care has urged Malaysian authorities to prioritize the production and shipment of gloves that are of utmost criticality for fighting COVID-19, showed a letter dated March 20 to glove maker Supermax Corp (SUPM.KL) and shared with Reuters.\nMARGMA is considering rationing due to the extremely high demand, its president Denis Low said. You can produce as many gloves as you can but then there\u2019s nothing to pack them into.\nUnder normal circumstances, Top Glove can meet less than 40% of its own packaging needs. For the remainder, it said just 23% of suppliers have gained approval to operate at half strength.\nWe are lobbying almost every hour, we are putting in a lot of letters to the ministry, said Low. We are lobbying hard for the chemical suppliers and we want to ensure that the printers are also being given approval and any other supporting services , even transportation.\nMalaysia\u2019s Ministry of International Trade and Industry on Tuesday said it had received masses of applications to operate through the lockdown, and that it was seeking cooperation from industries to give way to those producing essential goods.\nAUTOMATION\nDeveloped economies are home to only a fifth of the world\u2019s population yet account for nearly 70% medical glove demand due to stringent medical standards. At 150, U.S. glove consumption per-capita is 20 times that of China, latest MARGMA data showed.\nMARGMA expects demand to jump 16% to 345 billion gloves this year, with Malaysia\u2019s market share rising two percentage points to 65%. Thailand usually follows at about 18% and China at 9%.\nTop Glove said orders have doubled since February and it sees sales rising by a fifth in the next six months. Its stock, with a market value of about $3.5 billion, has risen by a third this year versus a fall of 16% in the wider market.\nThe company, with customers in 195 economies, registered the highest net money inflow last week among listed Malaysian firms, along with peer Hartalega Holdings Bhd (HTHB.KL), showed MIDF Research data. Other glove makers include Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd (KRIB.KL) and Careplus Group Bhd (CARE.KL).\nWe are fortunate enough to be in essential goods, said Lim. These few months and at least the next six months will be an all-time high in terms of sales volume, revenue and profit.\nWith more than 80% of its 44 factories worldwide automated, Top Glove itself is less impacted by the lockdown than its more labor-intensive domestic suppliers. Packaging woes aside, however, ramping up production could turn under-supply into over-supply when the coronavirus outbreak finally subsides.\nThis outbreak will create awareness and make humankind healthier, said Lim. People will pay more attention, they will invest more, they will buy more so demand will be more.

But health authorities said she sought care at a traditional medicine hospital in Daegu after a minor car accident, where a medical worker who treated her later tested positive for the virus. While running a fever, she went to a buffet at a hotel and the church services.\nShincheonji is in the biggest crisis in its 36-year history, as hundreds of members have tested positive for the virus, SARS-CoV-2. All of its 210,000 known followers are being tested amid unprecedented scrutiny from authorities and the public.\nAfter initial resistance, the church released the addresses of 1,100 facilities around the country - 82 churches and 1,018 \u201caffiliates,\u201d - and asked the public to avoid making \u201cgroundless criticism.\u201d It was the \u201cbiggest victim of the virus,\u201d it said.\nCalls by Reuters to the church\u2019s headquarters seeking comment went unanswered.\nDuring a visit to the Daegu branch on Friday, a man who identified himself as a member said he was the only one there and told Reuters that \u201call of our 9,000 members are taking self-quarantine measures in compliance with the government instruction.\u201d He said the building was disinfected twice last week.\nInteractive graphic about the spread of coronavirus inside South Korea: here\nSouth Korea reported 334 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the national tally to 1,595.

Many break ties with their family and begin aggressively recruiting new members, An said.\nAccording to its website, followers must undergo six months of classes and complete a demanding written exam before \u201cgraduating\u201d and joining the church.\nThe church has denied previous reports by Christian news organizations describing it as a \u201cbrainwashing cult\u201d, calling those accusations \u201cblatant lies\u201d and a plot to rein in its expansion.\nAll members work as \u201charvesters\u201d tasked with courting new followers from other churches, dubbed \u201charvest fields\u201d, former members said.\n\u201cIt may appear Christian, but is actually completely different. They revere founder Lee Man-hee as a saviour, like Jesus,\u201d said Lee Duck-sure, a Christian pastor who runs a counseling center in Seoul for former members of Shincheonji.\nSouth Koreans vented anger after an official at a Daegu public health center that carries out virus tests continued to work even after he was told to get tested. He revealed he was a member of the Daegu Shincheonji church only after the test showed he was infected, Daegu officials said.\nBut health officials and experts cautioned the blame should not be focused on the church and its believers, saying they were also victims.\nKCDC is also looking into links between the church and a hospital in nearby Cheongdo County, which reported the second-highest number of patients in the country with more than 110.\nThe county is a holy site for Shincheonji believers as the birthplace of Lee, and recently a funeral for his older brother was held at that hospital.\nOn a recent visit, the Daegu church was shuttered and silent, surrounded by empty streets and closed stores. Someone had thrown eggs at the front gate of the building.\nSon, who did not want to give her full name and lives in the neighborhood, said many believers, especially young women, have moved to live near the church, and several restaurants are run by members.\nDoo Song-Ja, 64, said she had not heard from her daughter since 2015, when she joined the church.\n\u201cI\u2019m so worried because so many Shincheonji followers are testing positive but I don\u2019t know where she is,\u201d said Doo, who said her 33-year-old daughter had sued her for \u201cforcible confinement\u201d for trying to keep her home. \u201cI just hope she is OK.\u201d "}, {"content": "Coronavirus: China keeps lending rate unchanged despite urgent stimulus need .

Under a category named Myth Busters, the WHO tries to fight myths. The authority belonging to the United Nations wants to oppose the rumors around the new coronavirus something. Because rumors, false information and conspiracy theories spread faster than the virus itself.\nAt the end of 2019, a new virus broke out in China, 2019ncov, closely related to the deadly SARS virus. Meanwhile, thousands of people are infected, hundreds died, long ago have reported many countries. Because the pathogen was unknown last year and the consequences of the outbreak are not yet estimable, the need for knowledge is big: Google Trends listed for January a rapidly increasing search for coronavirus. A demand that does not remain uncled: On Twitter, more than 15 million tweets have been discontinued to the Coronavirus over the past four weeks, new news and assessments appear daily in the media. There are so many contributions that WHO writes from an info name, an abundance of information - correct, but also false.\nIn general, one must distinguish between unsecured information, from the context of torn or false messages and conspiracy theories. For example, the story about a parents' couple allegedly left behind their two sick children at the airport. There is no evidence for this. Just as a video that spreads alleged facts about the virus in alarmistic sound. The allegations in it are partly exaggerated, partly unused, partly wrong, as the portal has researched correction.

Indian benchmark equity indices on Thursday collapsed once again as Sensex fell over 2,500 points while Nifty was down over 760 points or over seven per cent. The stock market shock comes a day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.\nAs far as domestic stock markets are concerned, the freefall has led to a significant rise in the volatility index, which indicates that investors still remain worried about the prevailing economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\nHere are key factors which led to the bloodbath on D-Street on Thursday:\nCoronavirus now a pandemic\nThe coronavirus is now a pandemic, declared WHO on Thursday. The development was announced by WHO in view of the rapid rise in Covid-19 infections around the globe. Declaring it as a pandemic triggered a massive slump in stock markets across the world. Asian, European and US market indices took a pounding as investors remain spooked. The US has suspended travel from Europe while India has suspended all tourist visa till April 15.\nIn the morning trade, aviation and tourism stocks plummeted sharply after as a result of the fresh restrictions on travel.\nIt is worth mentioning that the WHO has declared the novel coronavirus as a pandemic and added that Italy and Iran were the hotspot countries.

The global toll death toll has crossed 4,500 while India has recorded at least 73 positive cases.\nOil slides further\nAnother reason why domestic stock markets fell was a further slide in global crude oil prices. Oil prices have continued to slide since the major crash on March 6 following a meeting of the OPEC countries and Russia. A price war was triggered as Saudi slashed oil prices, resulting in the collapse of global crude oil prices.\nWhile prices had recovered slightly on March 11, the lower prices keep hurting sentiments of major oil companies in the country. Power and energy companies are also taking a pounding in the domestic stock market due to reduced prices. Though the general notion is that India benefits from any cut in global crude prices, the recent deep cut may not be ideal for the country.\nSharp fall in oil prices also has a greater impact on the equity market, as witnessed in the past few days. It could even disrupt the flow for foreign capital into the India market if crude prices keep falling.\nGlobal market rout\nNot just India but markets around the globe have witnessed carnage over the past few days due to the coronavirus outbreak. From Dow Jones in the US to other major markets in the world, each one has registered serious falls due to rising doubts over the total financial impact of the virus outbreak.\nStock markets around the world crumbled after Trump's move, with U.S. stock index futures diving 4.7% and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tumbling 4.1% to its lowest level since early 2019.\nAs the virus keeps spreading across the globe rapidly, analysts expect the carnage to continue until there is a global decline in new positive cases.\nInvestors will also be monitoring the situation in China, which conveyed that the number of cases in the epicentre Hubei province and Wuhan reduced significantly.

In addition, the Philippines and Australia have also announced having taken measures before the first suspected cases in their territory.\nWHO per Monday performed a visit to Wuhan with a group of Chinese health experts, led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, Director of the State Laboratory for Infectious Diseases in Canton and National Eminence. According to this conglomerate of experts, 15 medical employees in the city have contracted the virus, which confirms the contagion between humans - an extreme ruled out until last weekend.\nThe climbing of this new coronavirus, discovered two weeks ago, recalls the epidemic of SARS, with which it saves genetic similarities. The epidemic of 2002, also originated in China, caused the death of 700 people around the world.

DETROIT - Ford Motor Co <F.N> on Thursday moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business from the coronavirus pandemic.  \n The No. 2 U.S. automaker, whose shares closed off slightly after sinking as much as 8.9% earlier in the day, also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast and said the cash would be used to deal with a squeeze on capital caused by shutdowns in production due to the fast-spreading virus.  \n The move will give Ford more than $37 billion in cash, almost matching the revenue it reported in the fourth quarter. That dwarfs the company's market capitalization of about $18 billion.  \n Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note that corporate liquidity during the outbreak was \"top of mind\" and that U.S. automakers had strong balance sheets.  \n The coronavirus outbreak, which started in China last year, has caused about 219,000 infections and more than 8,900 deaths globally.  \n Comparing the current economic situation to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Chief Executive Jim Hackett said Ford was putting in place safeguards to protect its business.  \n \"We're at war with the virus and Ford is going to win,\" Hackett told employees on a video conference.  \n Ford has come under fire from some analysts on Wall Street for moving too slowly to cut costs and restructure its business.  \n At the end of last year, it had booked only $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take in its global restructuring.  \n Since then, the outbreak has spread globally, leading Ford, General Motors Co <GM.N> and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV <FCHA.MI>, <FCAU.N> on Wednesday to announce the shutdown of their North American plants to prevent the spread of the disease among their factory workers.  \n All three Detroit automakers have seen U.S. employees test positive for COVID-19, the contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus.  \n Electric carmaker Tesla Inc <TSLA.O> on Thursday suspended production at its California car plant, starting March 24, to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, and added that its cash position was strong enough to navigate this period of uncertainty.  \n  \n OUTLOOK REVISIONS  \n The outbreak has already hit other automakers and more are expected to slash their 2020 forecasts.  \n Evercore ISI analysts said in a research note that such actions \"will be an ongoing theme in addition to the removal of (stock) buybacks.\"  \n On Wednesday, German luxury automaker BMW AG <BMWG.DE> cut its 2020 profit outlook, saying it would be \"significantly lower\" than last year. Two days before that, Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co Ltd <601633.SS> also cut its 2020 sales and profit targets.  \n GM and FCA did not change their profit forecasts on Thursday.  \n \"We are dedicated to managing our cost structure against this dynamic environment,\" GM said in a statement. \"We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make any necessary decisions to stay resilient.\"  \n GM had $34.6 billion in liquidity at the end of 2019, including $17.3 billion in cash.  \n \"We are evaluating the impact of all steps being taken inside the company related to the coronavirus emergency on our current financial guidance,\" FCA said in a statement, adding it would provide an update when it has \"sufficient visibility on market conditions.\"  \n FCA had 23.1 billion euros ($24.94 billion) in liquidity at the end of 2019.  \n Shares of Uber Technologies Inc <UBER.N> closed up more than 38% on Thursday after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company had plenty of cash on hand.  \n \"In any crisis, liquidity is key,\" he said on an investor call.  \n Ford said on Thursday it notified lenders it would borrow the unused amounts of the two credit lines, totaling $15.4 billion. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company had $22 billion in cash at the end of last year.  \n The dividend suspension will save Ford money at an annual rate of $2.4 billion.  \n The company said it was prioritizing financial flexibility and investments in future technologies such as self-driving cars and a series of important 2020 vehicle launches including a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 full-size pickup truck.  \n Ford also withdrew its 2020 profit outlook. In February, before the coronavirus hit the United States, it offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for earnings in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share.  \n Ford said it would update its outlook when it reports first-quarter results on April 28.  \n Also on Thursday, Ford said it would offer new-car buyers up to six months of payment relief.

LAGOS/ABUJA - An Italian man who has been confirmed as Nigeria's first coronavirus case after arriving from Milan was in the country for almost two full days, travelling through Lagos and visiting another state before being isolated.  \n The case is the first in sub-Saharan Africa. Authorities fear the virus could spread quickly in a region where health systems are already overburdened with cases of malaria, measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases.  \n Lagos, with 20 million people, is the biggest city in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. The West African country, with a population of some 200 million people, has a shortage of doctors and hospitals are often poorly maintained.  \n The Italian man works for cement company Lafarge Africa Plc <WAPCO.LG> in the southwestern state of Ogun, the company said in a statement. It said it had identified people who had \"direct contact\" with him before carrying out \"isolation, quarantine and disinfection protocol.\"  \n The Ogun state governor, in a separate media briefing, said 28 people had been placed in quarantine by the company the man worked for, although he did not mention it by name.  \n The case has prompted a scramble by Nigerian authorities to try to \"meet and observe\" all passengers who arrived on the same flight as the man and to identify the places he visited before being hospitalised.  \n \"We have started working to identify all the contacts of the person since he entered Nigeria and even those who were with him on the aircraft,\" Health Minister Osagie Ehanire told reporters on Friday in the capital, Abuja.  \n The Italian, whose country has been hit harder hit by the virus than any other in Europe, arrived on Feb. 24 on a Turkish Airlines flight that had a connection in Istanbul, said Lagos state commissioner for health, Akin Abayomi.  \n After spending the night in a hotel near the airport, he went on Feb. 25 to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state, and stayed there until he developed a fever and body aches on the afternoon of Feb. 26, Abayomi told a news conference.  \n He was then transferred to a high containment facility in Yaba, Lagos state.  \n Ehanire said the infection was confirmed on Feb. 27 by the Virology Laboratory of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and that the man was now quarantined and doing well.  \n Turkish Airlines did not immediately comment on the case. There are no confirmed cases in Turkey.  \n Nigerian stocks fell 1.63% to their lowest level in two months on Friday following the announcement of the coronavirus case.  \n The spread of the new coronavirus from China has hit global financial markets, and Nigeria's economy is at risk from the tumbling price of oil, which accounts for 90% of its foreign exchange earnings.  \n The latest World Health Organization figures indicate over 82,000 people have been infected, with over 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries.  \n  \n LABORATORY NETWORK  \n Officials from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) are heading to Lagos to help address the case, and have activated its national Emergency Operations Centre.  \n International health organisation said they were working alongside their Nigerian counterparts.  \n Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said it is in contact with NCDC and is working with the WHO and other partners to support the Nigerian government's response.  \n In a statement it said it had deployed one epidemiologist to Nigeria to support assessment and response to the outbreak, and has shipped 1,000 COVID-19 laboratory test kits to the country.  \n And the WHO, which has said it already has experts in Nigeria, has identified Nigeria as one of 13 \"high priority\" countries in Africa. Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme, told a Geneva news conference on Friday that Nigeria had \"well-tested mechanisms for dangerous pathogens.\"  \n He said Nigeria was able to utilise a laboratory network that had been developed to handle cases of Lassa fever, monkeypox and influenza.  \n Schools and offices in Lagos provided hand sanitizer to people entering buildings on Friday.  \n \"There's a run on suppliers at the moment for hand sanitizer and masks,\" said Andrew Garza, chief operating officer of Lifestores Healthcare, a Lagos-based health technology company that provides inventory services to local pharmacies.  \n Garza said some stockists had sold out of hand sanitizer.  \n ($1 = 305.9200 naira) REUTERS "}, {"content": "what africa is doing to fight coronavirus.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) is not quick to declare global public health emergencies. \n From 2007 through 2019, the United Nations agency did so on only five occasions. The rapidly spreading new coronavirus that originated in December in China's Wuhan makes a sixth. \n The fallout from the organisation's Jan 30 call has spread rapidly. Four days later, the total number of countries placing border restrictions on Chinese travellers has surged to 60. They include Australia, India, Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, Russia and North Korea, and many countries have evacuated or are attempting to evacuate their citizens from Hubei province at the epidemic's epicentre. \n \"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems\" than China's, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet. \"I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern\u2026 not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.\" \n The new coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, can lead to severe and often deadly pneumonia. Even as the number of infections and deaths rapidly mounted in Hubei's capital Wuhan and cases appeared in a growing number of other countries, the WHO took a deliberate approach to evaluating the danger. \n The agency's emergency committee, in meetings on Jan 22-23, initially decided not to designate it a global crisis pending collection of more data. A week later, the WHO declared the coronavirus the first global public health emergency originating in China. Such a designation did not apply to even the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic 17 years ago. \n A look at how the organisation reached its decision shows some of the inner workings of the global system for preventing and managing the spread of dangerous new diseases. \n The system relies on the rapid sharing of information among national health systems and the global public health organisation. Although some Chinese officials have drawn criticism internally and abroad for initially trying to downplay the crisis, the WHO's Dr Tedros maintains China was quick to share information, enhancing the global response. \n \"In many ways, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response,\" Dr Tedros said at a press conference. \"We would have seen many more cases outside China by now, and probably deaths, if not for the government's efforts.\" \n Data from China on the pathogen allowed Japan, South Korea and Thailand to diagnose similar cases quickly, he said. For example, a Chinese laboratory warned the German government of an infected person returning to Germany. \n Dr Tedros, an Ethiopian public health expert, arrived on Jan 27 in Beijing to meet Chinese officials. During his visit, President Xi Jinping called on the country to be transparent in working with the rest of the world and agreed to allow the WHO to send a group of international experts into the country to study the new strain of coronavirus alongside Chinese counterparts. \n Those data-gathering steps helped fill the information gap that kept the WHO's emergency panel from issuing its global warning sooner. \n Before the Jan 22-23 meetings Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters"}, {"content": "Global downturn looms as countries struggle to contain coronavirus outbreak.

"}, {"content": "grief in a pandemic: holding a dying mother's hand with a latex glove. KIRKLAND, Wash. - Doug Briggs put on a surgical gown, blue gloves and a powered respirator with a hood. He headed into the hospital room to see his mother - to tell her goodbye.  \n Briggs took his phone, sealed in a Ziplock bag, into the hospital room and cued up his mother's favourite songs. He put it next to her ear and noticed her wiggle, ever so slightly, to the music.  \n \"She knew I was there,\" Briggs recalled, smiling.  \n Between songs by Barbara Streisand and the Beatles, Briggs conference-called his aunts to let them speak to their sister one last time. \"I love you, and I'm sorry I'm not there with you. I hope the medicine they're giving you is making you more comfortable,\" said Meri Dreyfuss, one of her sisters.  \n Somewhere between \"Stand by Me\" and \"Here, There, and Everywhere,\" Barbara Dreyfuss passed away \u2013 her hand in her son's, clad in latex. It would be two days before doctors confirmed that she had succumbed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  \n Dreyfuss, 75, was the eighth U.S. patient to die in a pandemic that has now killed more than 1,200 nationally and nearly 25,000 worldwide. She was among three dozen deaths linked to the Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, the site of one of the first and deadliest U.S. outbreaks. (For interactive graphics tracking coronavirus in the United States and worldwide, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uj9ry0 and https://tmsnrt.rs/3akNaFr )  \n Dreyfuss's final hours illustrate the heartrending choices now facing families who are forced to strike a balance between staying safe and comforting their sick or dying loved ones. Some have been cut off from all contact with parents or spouses who die in isolation, while others have strained to provide comfort or to say their final goodbyes through windows or over the phone.  \n Just three days before his mother died, Briggs had been making weekend plans with her. Now, in his grief, he found himself glued to news reports and frustrated by the mixed messages and slow response from local, state and federal officials.  \n \"You find out all these things, of what they knew when,\" Briggs said.  \n Officials from Life Care Centers of America have said the facility responded the best it could to one of the worst crises ever to hit an eldercare facility, with many staffers stretched to the brink as others were sidelined with symptoms of the virus. As the first U.S. site hit with a major outbreak, the centre had few protocols for a response and little help from the outside amid national shortages of test kits and other supplies.  \n   \n 'NOT FEELING TOO GOOD'  \n A flower child of the 1960's, Dreyfuss lived a life characterized by art and activism. After marrying her high school sweetheart and giving birth to their son, she pursued a degree in women's studies at Cal State Long Beach, where she marched for women's equality and abortion rights.  \n Furious over President Gerald Ford's pardoning of former president Richard Nixon in 1974 , Dreyfuss took to her typewriter and penned an angry letter to Ford. \"Today is my son's 9th birthday,\" she wrote of a young Briggs. \"I do not feel like celebrating.\"  \n By the time she arrived at the Life Care Center in May 2019, years of health issues had dimmed some of that spark, her son said. Fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis restricted her to a walker or a wheelchair, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease required her to have a constant flow of oxygen.  \n When her son visited on Feb. 25, he brought a grocery bag of her favourites, including diet A&W root beer. She awoke from a nap and smiled at him, but hinted at her discomfort.  \n \"Hi Doug,\" she said. \"I'm not feeling too good.\"  \n Still, Dreyfuss talked about an upcoming visit with her sisters - the movies she wanted to see, the restaurants she wanted to try. The mother and son then had only a vague awareness of the deadly virus then ravaging China.  \n In hindsight, Briggs realized he had witnessed the first signs of her distress. His mother was using more oxygen than usual, her breathing was more strained.  \n At the time, staff at the nursing home believed they were handling a flu outbreak and were unaware the coronavirus had started to take hold, a spokesman has said.  \n   \n 'A TINY FOOTNOTE'  \n Two days later, Briggs dropped by to see his mom. She felt congested, and staff were going to X-ray her lungs for fluid. Briggs, 54, still saw no red flags, and continued to discuss weekend plans with his mother.  \n \"I hope we can finally watch that new Mr. Rogers movie,\" she told him, referring to the film, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood.  \n Briggs hugged his mom before she was wheeled to the imaging room and drove for a quick meal. Soon after, he received a call from the nursing home. His mother was experiencing respiratory failure. She was on her way to the hospital. Doug rushed to nearby EvergreenHealth Medical Center. By then, she was unresponsive.  \n At the time, there were 59 U.S. cases of coronavirus, a number that has since soared to more than 85,000.  \n After hearing of her sister's sudden hospitalisation, Meri Dreyfuss remembered an earlier voicemail from Barbara: her distant voice, groaning for 30 seconds. When she had first heard it, she assumed Dreyfuss had called by accident, but now she realized her sister was in pain. \"It haunts me that I didn't pick up the phone,\" she said.  \n Briggs spent close to 10 hours the next day in his mom's hospital room. He wore a medical mask and anxiously watched her vital signs \u2013 especially the line tracking her oxygen saturation.  \n On his way out the door, a doctor took him aside to say they were testing her for the coronavirus. He remembered the difficulty reconciling the outbreak taking place on television - far away, in China - with what was happening in his mother's hospital room.  \n In the Bay Area, Meri and Hillary Dreyfuss were packing their suitcases on Feb. 28 when Briggs telephoned. After the call, they decided that visiting their sister would pose too much danger of infection.  \n \"I realized there was no way we were going to get on a plane at that point, because we couldn't see her,\" said the middle sister, Hillary. \"And now, it seemed that we shouldn't be seeing Doug, either.\"  \n They cancelled their flights. On Saturday, Feb. 29, Briggs learned his mother's condition was deteriorating. Tough decisions loomed. Briggs and his aunts decided to prioritise making her comfortable over keeping her alive. Doctors gave her morphine to relax the heaviness in her lungs.  \n She died the next day.  \n Having emerged from a two-week quarantine, Briggs will soon retrieve his mother's cremated remains. The family has been struggling with how to memorialize her life in such chaotic times.  \n \"All the things that one would want to happen in the normal mourning process have been subsumed by this larger crisis,\" said Hillary Dreyfuss. \"It's almost as though her death has become a tiny footnote in what's going on.\" REUTERS "}, {"content": "Coronavirus deaths eclipse global toll from Sars, but 'fewer unknowns' now about the virus. LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus disease spreading around the world has killed more than 810 people, exceeding the toll from the global outbreak of Sars that started in China almost two decades ago. \n Less than two months after surfacing in late December in Wuhan, China, cases of the coronavirus have topped 37,000. The fast-spreading disease long ago eclipsed the 8,100 total cases of Sars, which was transmitted worldwide in eight months, disrupting travel, industry and health care, and killing 774 people before coming under control. \n Both severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars, and the coronavirus are members of a larger family known to cause disease ranging from common colds to lethal infections. While both emerged from China before spreading to multiple countries, their paths have diverged in a number of significant ways. \n The rate of deaths among people infected with Sars was close to 10 per cent, said David Heymann, who oversaw the World Health Organization's (WHO) response to the outbreak, while it appears that rate in coronavirus will be below 2 per cent. An analysis of about 17,000 coronavirus patients showed that 82 per cent had mild cases, WHO officials said in a press briefing. \n \"You have to compare the two in perspective,\" Heymann said in an interview. The coronavirus outbreak \"could look more dramatic than it is.\" \n The number of cases and deaths from the new coronavirus may be far higher. The health system in Wuhan has been overwhelmed by the disease, with limited ability to care for every patient or diagnose new cases. Other cases may have been too mild to be counted by Chinese officials. \n \"I'm taking them for their word, but I really can't guarantee that they're reporting the right number. The only way you can guarantee it is if you go there and you monitor them,\" said Anthony S. Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. US officials have been trying to get a team into China to better study the outbreak. \n The epidemic of Sars began in 2002 with a report of mysterious pneumonia in southern China's province of Guangdong. It shifted into a higher gear when it was amplified in hospitals and then, carried by international travellers, spread to 26 countries. \n Hospital workers were at particularly high risk, as so-called super-spreading events sickened multiple doctors and nurses. The outbreak was finally controlled by July 2003 with improved infection-control procedures and the WHO's recommendations to limit travel to areas where the outbreak was still out of control. \n While Sars infected and killed hundreds of people outside China, the newer virus, known as 2019-nCoV, has been mostly confined to the mainland, with all but two of the known fatalities there. Even as China has been lauded for its quick action and open communication regarding the outbreak, a number of unknowns continue to heighten concern about the disease. \n \"When you don't know your enemy, the fear of your enemy grows,\" said Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme, said on Friday at a press conference. \n Researchers still don't know exactly how the virus is spread. All signs point to droplet transmission, which means that small bits of fluid from the mouth and nose that carry the disease move from one person to the next, usually in face-to-face encounters. \n There's some evidence that people who aren't experiencing symptoms - coughing, sneezing, muscle pain - can also spread the virus. That means airport screeners, as well as patients themselves, stand little chance of finding infected people. Some researchers also think the disease might be spread through contaminated faeces, which was also the case with Sars and presents other prevention challenges. \n The severity of the coronavirus outbreak led to a lockdown of Wuhan city and Hubei province - with more than 58 million people - along with some other areas of China. The nation has become a virtual island as an increasing number of governments and airlines impose restrictions on travel from the mainland. \n The WHO hasn't recommended travel limits related to the coronavirus, but countries are desperately trying to keep the illness from their shores. Research on the new virus is moving quickly, and more may be known soon about how the disease spreads and how to stop it, Heymann said. \"There are already fewer and fewer unknowns,\" he said.

Consequences of the measures against the spread of the virus are lower demand and production losses in many industries, he said on presentation of the annual figures.\nEspecially in the first and second quarter BASF expects negative effects. \"I warn to give too early all-clear, just because the figures of the patients go back in China,\" underlined Bruderm\u00fcller. He does not expect that the coronavirus effects can be fully compensated in the course of the year.\nFor the full year 2020, the company chief expects the global economy to grow with two percent significantly slower than 2019. For global chemistry, it also expects significantly lower growth with 1.2 percent. \"That would be by far the lowest growth since the financial crisis 2008/2009\", Brotherm\u00fcller added.\n\"If I had to overwrite that, I would throw our team: push his knees!\" Said the BASF boss. \"We just make our strategy that is right. We can not change the environment. But we can do the best of it. \"\nDue to the still uncertain follow of the coronavirus, BASF has given a large range for the target targets - \"This shows the uncertainty\".

For adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), the company dates \u20ac 4.2 billion to \u20ac 4.8 billion - after a decline of 28 percent to 4.5 billion euros in 2019.\nFor 2019, BASF wants to distribute a little more money to the shareholders than expected. The dividend should be increased by 10 cents to 3.30 euros per share. Profit after taxes and minorities rose by almost 80 percent year-on-year to 8.4 billion euros in 2019. But here was a book gain from the deconsolidation of the oil and host of Wintershall in the amount of around 5.7 billion euros.\n\"In 2019, a challenging year was with strong global economic counterwind,\" said Bruderm\u00fcller. The trade conflicts between the US and China had a negative, important sales markets developed slower. In addition, uncertainties would be related to the Brexit. Demand from many important customer industries has declined significantly, especially from the automotive industry.\nIn order to make the Group more profitable, the Brotherm\u00fcller, which has been reigned for almost two years, set austerity program at the end of 2018. These include job deletions. The austerity price has accelerated BASF, said Bruderm\u00fcller. Now the degradation of 6000 jobs will be achieved at the end of 2020, a year earlier than planned. Last year, BASF already built 3100 places worldwide. In return, BASF plans investments of 23.6 billion euros in the coming five years.\nLast year, BASF merged its oil and hosts Wintershall with the competitor DEA. The company should go to the stock market in the second half of the year in Frankfurt. \"We prepare an IPO,\" said BASF Financial Chef Hans-Ulrich Engel. Whether he also comes as planned, but depends on market conditions.\nThe BASF majority stake Wintershall Dea is the focus because of the construction of the controversial line Nord Stream 2. Wintershall Dea is financially involved in the pipeline, the gas directly from Russia via the Baltic Sea to Germany. The project is a mandrel in the US. Therefore, the companies that build on the pipeline threaten sanctions. The construction is currently on ice.\n\"It is thought about alternatives for the completion of Nord Stream 2,\" said Angel. After the building, Russia had set a specialship for laying gas tubes in motion. At the moment, the stop has no concrete disadvantages for Wintershall Dea, Angel said. The pipeline should be completed at the end of 2020. (dpa) "}, {"content": "Coronavirus effect on world economy grows more alarming.

On March 24, while announcing a three-week preventive lockdown of the entire country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi allocated Rs 15,000 crore to boost the health infrastructure. The funds will be used to create additional hospital beds, build on the stockpile of COVID-19 testing kits and train medical practitioners. The Centre is putting in place protocols, including the acquisition of medical equipment and protection gear needed in the special isolation wards and facilities. A training protocol for frontline health workers is also being prepared.\nThe funds announced are a beginning. We would need more, depending on how soon we can end this affliction. Earlier, states were only using National Health Mission (NHM) funds. Now, they have access to a central fund, says Dr V.K. Paul, public health expert and a member of NITI Aayog. The first thing to do with the funds is equip hospitals, with personal protective gear, ventilators, additional oxygen, drugs and train staff. While isolation wards are being created, Dr Paul says COVID-specific facilities also need to be looked at for Stage 3. In Geneva, they are out of ICU (intensive care unit) beds. Such is the virulence of the disease at its peak. We need good hospitals that is where the focus is now. To support hospitals, we must also have isolation facilities, a strict surveillance system and should even consider setting up call centres in medical colleges, he says. Dr Paul maintains that India is still at Stage 2 (local transmission), but testing is being done more widely now.\nKerala, which has both an enduring healthcare system and a strong network of Panchayati raj bodies, is stealing a march on other states with its preparedness.

Even a minor lapse can prove disastrous, Vijayan cautioned office-bearers of local bodies during a video conference on March 19. If there is a spurt in cases, the existing facilities would not be enough to meet the requirements. Since the vast majority under observation would be home-quarantinedas people under special care\u2019, Kerala\u2019s strategy is to get the local bodies to take responsibility for local communities and ensure they do not face logistical problems while handling the situation.\n2 Dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and ICUs\nWith a hospital bed to population ratio of just 1:1,000 or around a million hospital beds in all, less than 100,000 ICU beds and only 40,000 ventilators at hand, India\u2019s healthcare infrastructure is ill-equipped to face a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases.

SINGAPORE \u2014 The Covid-19 situation is forcing businesses to think even harder about diversification \u2014 from making sure that their supply of labour comes from different countries, to housing their foreign workers in different dormitories, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing. \n His comments came after a two-hour dialogue with about 25 corporate leaders in Singapore on Friday (Feb 14), where they aired their concerns about the impact that the virus has had on their businesses. \n Mr Chan told reporters that the outbreak has mainly affected tourism-related sectors, the food and beverage sectors and the retail sectors but there are some sub-sectors that are still holding up pretty well. \n For other sectors, such as manufacturing, Mr Chan said the business leaders are not only concerned about the potential disruptions to the supply chain from China, but also the supply chains that come indirectly from China to the rest of the world and to Singapore. \n Business leaders also cited short term cash flow as being another concern, he said, although they added that they are taking steps to diversify their sources of supply chains and labour. \n He noted that because of the United States-China trade war last year, some companies had already begun undertaking measures to diversify their supply chains and it is likely that the Covid-19 outbreak will push more businesses to do the same. \n With regard to the supply of labour, Mr Chan said the business leaders agreed that there is a need to reassess where their manpower comes from so that they can avoid relying on a particular country for labour. \n However, Mr Chan added that the more pressing issue for local businesses is ensuring that their workers do not all stay in the same dormitories. \n \u201cSome of the companies, especially the smaller ones, might conveniently house their workers all at the same place. \n \u201cBut that is not a very resilient business continuity plan and I think we want to help many of these smaller companies to diversify their supply chain and mitigate these risks at the local level.\u201d \n To mitigate the problem of cash flow, Mr Chan said that business leaders can do their part by helping each other tide through the challenging times. \n \u201cThe larger contractors must not withhold payment from the smaller contractors, otherwise it will impact the entire ecosystem negatively,\u201d he said. \n Agreeing, Mr Ernie Koh, who is the executive director of furniture manufacturer Koda and an adviser to the Singapore Furniture Industries Council, said companies whose \u201cbalance sheets are strong\u201d and can pull through the current downturn should help support those who are struggling. \n \u201cI have always believed in supporting local businesses\u2026 Everyone has to stay afloat and with the big boys helping the small ones, we can all stay afloat (through this period),\u201d said Mr Koh, who was one of the representatives present at the closed-door meeting. \n BUSINESSES CONFIDENT OVER GOVERNMENT MEASURES  \n Speaking to reporters after the meeting , Mr Chan said he was also happy with the feedback from the business leaders that they are confident with the measures that have been taken by the Government to combat the outbreak. \n \u201cMany of them said they are assured that Singapore has expanded its surveillance regime to help detect more cases compared to some other countries who may not have been as rigorous in their detection and surveillance processes,\u201d he said. \n The business leaders also told Mr Chan that they were looking forward to \u201cposition themselves for the recovery\u201d and rebound from the ongoing crisis. \n To do so, the companies have taken advantage of the current situation to strengthen the training of their workers, review their current business models and production processes, said Mr Chan. \n \u201cI think this speaks very well for our business community that while they manage the current situation, they also have an eye for the future to make sure that we can be the fastest one to recover (from the crisis).\u201c \n Mr Alexander Melchers, vice-president of the Singapore National Employers Federation, said that after the Sars outbreak in 2003 was contained, the rebound for businesses was significant. \n That is why Mr Melchers, whose firm C Melchers Gmbh & Co is in the luxury goods business, has already started to make preparations for when the economy picks up again. \n \u201cI\u2019m telling my staff and the people that I work with to get ready for the upturn. There will be a rebound and we want to be ready for it. The staff needs to be there and they need to be skilled, ready and motivated,\u201d he said. \n MEASURES TO SUPPORT WORKERS TO BE ANNOUNCED DURING BUDGET 2020 \n When asked on how the Government will support businesses who are struggling during this period, Mr Chan said additional measures to support businesses and workers during this downturn will be announced on Tuesday in Budget 2020. \n The Budget Speech will be delivered by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in Parliament on Feb 18 at 3pm. \n Mr Chan added that the authorities have taken lessons from previous national crises such as the Sars outbreak, the global financial crisis and H1N1 when designing the measures. But since each crisis still has its own unique set of challenges, he cautioned that the measures will not necessarily be the same. \n \u201cSo while we can take a lesson from the past, we must also apply them in context,\u201d he said.

Certain mathematical models for simulating financial markets are similar to those for studying epidemics. \n We know this because we are two financial modellers who have been involved in modelling epidemics for public health authorities. \n Here, we would like to do our bit for public education on the Covid-19 outbreak by explaining five concepts from epidemiology, which is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why.\u00a0 \n The hope is that when the public is better able to understand what information about Covid-19 is shared, it will minimise irrational fear. \n KEY STATISTICS \n The media has been reporting on the number of newly infected and deaths cases daily. What is equally important is the number of recoveries, which is infrequently reported by the media. \n Imagine this: There are 10\u00a0newly infected and three deaths one day.\u00a0This sounds terrible, but if eight people recover on that day, then there is a net \u201cexit\u201d of one patient (3+8-10) from the pool. \n In any epidemic, perhaps the most important indicator is whether the net pool is increasing or decreasing. \n Another helpful statistic is the growth factor, which is each day's new cases divided by new cases from the previous day. \u00a0 \n The growth factor computed from total cases reported (worldwide) was mostly below one from Feb 13 to 19, but surged back to mostly above one from Feb 20 until now, as infections began spreading rapidly beyond China to other countries. \n Sophisticated models should also consider relevant country-level statistics, such as population, density, travel frequencies, medical resources available per capita and spare capacities in health systems to cope with infectious diseases.\u00a0 \n EPIDEMIC PYRAMID \n The typical classifications in an epidemic pyramid are death, severe, mild and asymptomatic, as follows:\u00a0 \n  \n Learning from their Sars outbreak experience in 2003, Singapore and Taiwan have resources and operating procedures in place to reach deep down the pyramid to trace every (asymptomatic) case possible even before symptoms are shown. \u00a0 \n But let\u2019s be realistic.\u00a0No matter how effective the screening process is, there will be misdiagnosis. \n Initial statistics collected from any outbreak almost always understate the full burden.\u00a0 \n For example, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially estimated 12,469 deaths for the H1N1 virus in the US from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010. But by 2019, it increased its estimate for that period to at least 75,000 deaths, or six times the earlier figure. \n Initial observed fatality statistics can be used to project the full burden with data that may take months or even years to arrive.\u00a0This is called a cross-sectional problem because we take one cross section of the pyramid to make an educated guess on the size of a deeper cross section of the pyramid.\u00a0 \n Case fatality rate is the number of deaths over a defined period of time divided by the number of individuals diagnosed with the disease during that time.\u00a0 \n This is a different problem by focusing on the time dimension. As long as epidemic models are careful in drawing conclusions from data already available at specific time points , they can still provide helpful insights. \n TOCC (TRAVEL, OCCUPATION, CONTACT, CLUSTER) TRACING \n Some countries may be too big in physical size. Many lack the resources to test and diagnose every suspected case.\u00a0 \n Moreover, many patients avoid seeking medical help until they show severe symptoms. As a result, we have to assume that a portion of undiagnosed patients may still be infecting others in the overall population.\u00a0 \n As long as there is a way to perform TOCC tracing from the diagnosed cases, there is a path to slow down the spread of infections.\u00a0 \n Public health officials worry the most about infections from unknown sources\u00a0\u2014 also known as the silent patients\u00a0\u2014 in which contacts cannot be back-traced easily.\u00a0 \n When the silent patients include say a taxi driver, he or she may have infected some passengers with no easy way to trace all related passengers riding his/her taxi.\u00a0 \n That is how epidemic control can become extremely challenging.\u00a0 \n Those were the worrying signs observed in the early stages in Wuhan and Hubei, and perhaps we are noticing similar patterns emerging in Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy.\u00a0\u00a0 \n TREATMENTS \n From an epidemiological point of view, patients are removed from the pool by either recoveries or deaths.\u00a0 \n The human body does have natural mechanisms to rid itself of viruses including the Covid-19 virus, but that is not always successful before the onset of other fatal complications.\u00a0 \n Therefore, the medical goal is to increase recoveries by treatments and to decrease deaths. \n Certain treatments such as antibody therapy have been around since the 1970s.\u00a0The issues are what dosage to use for which types of patients, and whether there are any potential side effects.\u00a0 \n Safe vaccines may take many months to develop by clinical trials.\u00a0 \n In a public health emergency such as the outbreak in Wuhan, public health authorities may choose to bypass lengthy clinical trial procedures, but it is unwise if shortcuts are taken everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n EPIDEMIC MODELS \n Epidemiologists describe the dynamics of how a disease is spread with mathematical models to better predict the effectiveness of disease control measures using \u201cbefore and after\u201d analyses. \n Impactful epidemic models require: 1) reasonable and transparent data as model parameters, or the entire exercise will become \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d; 2) a research environment where model results can be discussed openly to focus time and energy on the roughly correct models.\u00a0 \n There is a legitimate policy concern that raw data may be prone to misinterpretations by potentially faulty analyses, creating unnecessary fear among the public. \n Discussions among responsible scientists can take place in a \u201cmoderated\u201d but still expedited forum (such as on the medRxiv server co-hosted by Yale) to encourage participation and to minimise unnecessary overreactions to preliminary results. \n This way, \u201cscientifically credible\u201d clinical data can be released in a much shorter timeframe than the typical journal peer review process to allow other scientists to begin accessing the data, creating a win-win solution to address both scientific and public policy concerns. \n We encourage everyone with a good grasp of these concepts to review the primary sources instead of relying solely on secondary sources to interpret the statistics.\u00a0 \n For example, a recent report by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre and the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London shows the estimates of the overall case fatality ratio in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of Covid-19 to be approximately 1 per cent.\u00a0 \n The confidence range is from 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent.\u00a0At the low end of the range or 0.5 per cent, Covid-19 is a low fatality but highly infectious disease like a terrible influenza, but public health officials may need to consider additional measures at the high end of the range or 4 per cent.\u00a0 \n Armed with better understanding of information shared, the public will be more prepared until effective vaccines and treatments become widely available.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Anthony G\u00a0Constantinides is Professor of Communications and Signal Processing of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and heads the Financial Signal Processing Lab at Imperial College London.\u00a0Imperial alumnus Dr Bernard Lee is Founder and CEO of financial analytics firm HedgeSPA and author of Investment Analytics in the Dawn of Artificial Intelligence.

He is now in police custody.\nIt is an incident more than the many who reveal these days the fury of the public around a crisis, the coronavirus epidemic, of which they blame the disastrous management of the local authorities of Wuhan and his province, Hubei. An epidemic that has already infected about 10,000 people and in which, despite the reinforcement of supplies and the sending of thousands of additional physicians and health, sufficient protective material continues in hospitals and doctors and nurses are on the verge of exhaustion.\nThe tension between the central government -disposed to end the epidemic and the discontent of the oblation at all costs-, and local authorities who want to avoid responsible for chaos, is evident these days, in which the accusations of the one and the other side. And the lowest step carries to lose. According to Southern Weekly magazine, and 33 municipal or provincial levels have been dismissed, admonished or have opened a file for bad management of the crisis.\nAt discomfort for overflow in health centers, the publication of a series of scientific information has been added that corroborate the suspicions that key information was hidden during the first weeks, while the problem became increasing in December and the Greater part of January.\nA report of a large group of Official Chinese experts, which published on Wednesday the New England Journal of Medicine, found, after examining the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, that the contagions between human beings began to occur from mid-December. But the authorities insisted that there was no indications of it. Finally, it was admitted on January 20, when the spread of the epidemic began to shoot.\n\"Say that I'm furious is to stay short. I do not have words, \"he published in Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, the professor of Biology at the University of Zhejiang Wang Liming, after reading the report,\" is the first solid test that it was intentionally hidden that there were contagions between humans. \" The message of it has since been erased.\nA good part of the angers are directed not against the central government - the consensus among the majority of the population is that things have improved since it has taken control of the crisis - but against the provincial authorities of Hubei and the Mayor of Wuhan , Zhou Xianwang, a figure that seems to have the days counted in office. The last one in attacking against him has been the chief epidemiologist at the Disease Prevention and Control Center , Zeng Guang. In an interview with the Global Times State newspaper, it has pointed out that the Wuhan Municipal Government may have taken to respond to the crisis \"mainly due to the lack of scientific knowledge\" on the new type of coronavirus, but also by \"some indecision in the Taking measures \".\nDuring these first vital weeks, according to criticism, Zhou not only took to offering information, but he acted so that, in all, he helped to disseminate the infection. At the beginning of January he organized a meal with 40,000 people to beat a record of participation. And he insisted that people go on vacation for the Lunar New Year: before the quarantine close on the 23 million, five million people had left.\nHe is also accused of trying to suppress information. On January 1, the Wuhan Police announced that he had taken \"legal measures\" against eight people suspected of \"spread rumors\" - a position he can suppose up to seven years in prison - to denounce that those cases of strange disease that had been detected They looked like Sars. The severe acute respiratory syndrome, also originated in China and who killed nearly 800 people around the world in 2003, is caused by another coronavirus of the same family as the current one.\nThis week, the police have withdrawn the accusations against eight, after the Supreme Court be very critical against the performance of that body. \"It would have been lucky if people had believed them (the 'rumors'), and it would have begun to wear masks and take precautionary measures,\" it has lamented.\nIn a televised interview on Monday, Zhou acknowledged that the City Council did not disclose the necessary information as soon as he had it at hand and offered the resignation of it.

MONTREAL - The U.N.'s aviation agency on Friday approved restrictions for a global program designed to help airlines offset their carbon emissions, a move that curbs industry funding for older projects whose environmental benefits have been challenged by climate activists.  \n The International Civil Aviation Organization council approved recommendations to exclude offset projects begun before 2016 while delivering emission reductions through end-2020, ICAO said in a statement, confirming a report earlier in the day by Reuters.  \n ICAO cannot impose rules but sets standards approved by its 193 member countries. Its 36-member council was tasked with weighing which programs would be eligible under the venture for airlines, known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).  \n The council's decision to accept credits from six programs for CORSIA's pilot phase from 2021-2023 came despite protests from Brazil, China and India, which wanted older projects to be eligible, said two sources who discussed the private talks on condition of anonymity.  \n Developing countries had hoped a global push by airlines to offset emissions would mop up a glut of carbon credits awarded under earlier climate initiatives.  \n One of the six programs is the United Nations' Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the world's largest offset scheme set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to help fund emissions reductions in developing countries.  \n The fate of billions of older CDM credits, the majority of which come from China and India, was a thorny and unresolved issue for climate negotiators in Madrid in December, raising the stakes for ICAO.  \n ICAO was under pressure to strike a balance between approving enough credit options for airlines to purchase under the plan without squashing supply, which could push up prices.  \n Some environmentalists feared the council would approve weaker standards to help airlines hard-hit by the global outbreak of a coronavirus called COVID-19 that has led carriers to seek urgent government financial support.

Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which lasted four months in Singapore in 2003, the current Covid-19 outbreak in Singapore is likely to continue for at least a year. \n He outlined some baseline things Singapore must get used to \u2014\u00a0such as practising good personal hygiene and social distancing \u2014\u00a0and how the country must plan for a possible spike in cases. \n Here, I would\u00a0like to elaborate on some key features of the Covid-19 pandemic that may be less well-known and what they mean\u00a0for how Singapore tackles the outbreak. \n First, we know that an infected person will typically transmit the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) to two to three close contacts, predominantly via droplet spread. \n What is less commonly known is the serial interval, defined as the duration between the onset of symptoms of an infected person and the symptom onset of the people he or she transmits the virus to. \n This is between four and six days for the coronavirus, longer than the serial interval of influenza (two to three days). \n Thus the spread of Sars-CoV-2 has been slower and less explosive than a pandemic influenza virus, which last emerged in 2009. \n This slightly longer serial interval provides more time for contact tracing and interventions such as the quarantining\u00a0of close contacts to break the chain of transmission. \n However, Covid-19 is characteristically mild during the first few days, and is virtually indistinguishable from an ordinary upper respiratory tract infection \u2014\u00a0upwards of 20 per cent of patients may not have fever at the start, but are nonetheless infectious. \n Of greater importance is that approximately 5 per cent of confirmed adult cases will require mechanical ventilatory support in an intensive care setting. \n The mortality rate was strikingly high in China\u2019s Wuhan and Italy\u2019s Lombardy because hospitals were overwhelmed and intensive care facilities were not available to many who required them. \n Secondly, there is no proven effective treatment for Covid-19 as yet, although more than 100 clinical trials are being launched. \n Several Sars-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have been developed. However, having a commercially available vaccine available in just over a year from now remains an optimistic estimate, even with expedited regulatory approval in view of the multiple safety and efficacy trials necessary. \n Thirdly, the contours of the epidemic have\u00a0changed substantially since the start of the year. China is no longer the epicentre of the outbreak after weeks of extraordinary efforts including the lockdown of Wuhan and several cities in Hubei. \n Iran and Italy, however, became secondary epicentres for the spread of the virus to the Middle East and Europe respectively, while struggling to cope with their own outsized local outbreaks. \n Cases have now increased dramatically worldwide Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters"}, {"content": "Stella Calloni: The Coronavirus put the world between the solidarity dignities and the miserability of a system that agonizes.

Across the wider Mideast, there are over 1,150 cases of the new coronavirus, the majority of which are linked back to Iran.\nExperts worry Iran's percentage of deaths to infections, around 5.5%, is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be much higher than current figures show.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi opened the online news conference addressing the outbreak, dismissing an offer of help for Iran by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nIran and the US have seen some of the worst tensions since its 1979 Islamic Revolution in recent months, culminating in the American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad and a subsequent Iranian ballistic missile counterattack against U.S. forces.\n\"We neither count on such help nor are we ready to accept verbal help,\" Mousavi said. He added Iran has always been \"suspicious\" about America's intentions and accused the US government of trying to weaken Iranians' spirits over the outbreak.\nThe British Embassy meanwhile has begun evacuations over the virus.\n\"Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain,\" the British Foreign Office said. \"In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited.\"\nWhile Iran has closed schools and universities to stop the spread of the virus, major Shiite shrines have remained open despite civilian authorities calling for them to be closed.\nThe holy cities of Mashhad and Qom in particular, both home to shrines, have been hard-hit by the virus. Shiites often touch and kiss shrines as a sign of their faith.\nAuthorities have been cleaning the shrines with disinfectants.\nPolice have arrested one man who posted a video showing himself licking the metal enclosing the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, the most-important Shiite saint buried in the country, according to reports by semiofficial news agencies.\nIn the video, the man said he licked the metal to \"allow others to visit the shrine with peace of mind.\"\nMeanwhile Monday, the virus outbreak saw itself dragged into the yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations over a political dispute.\nA prominent columnist at Dubai's government-owned Al-Bayan newspaper on Twitter falsely described the virus as being a plot by Qatar to hurt the upcoming Expo 2020 world's fair in Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Noura al-Moteari later described the tweet as \"satire\" to The Associated Press after it gained widespread attention.\nThe Dubai Media Office similarly described the tweet as being written in a \"cynical style\" while distancing the Arabic-language daily from al-Moteari.\n\"Noura is a freelance writer and is not an employee of Al-Bayan nor does she represent the publication's views,\" it told the AP. \"That being said, this has no relevance to any social media policy being practiced by the publication nor the state.\"\nThe tweet comes after Qatar expressed disappointment Sunday that nearly all of its Gulf neighbors snubbed invitations to attend the weekend peace signing ceremony between the US and the Taliban.

The war with Japan, who invaded China as part of his expansionist plans even before World War II, put an end to Chiang Kai-Shek's attempts to unify the country. Before the Japanese advance, the KMT government was forced to leave the capital, Nanjing, withdrawing to Wuhan and then to the remote city of Chongqing.\r\nIn July 1967, at the height of the cultural revolution, the so-called 'Wuhan' incident has occurred: an armed conflict between two groups fighting for the control of the city.

"}, {"content": "covid-19: hopes for vaccine rise after chinese scientists find infected monkeys developed immunity. HONG KONG \u2014 Scientists who infected monkeys with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 have found that those that recovered developed effective immunity from the disease \u2014 a potentially important discovery in the race to develop a vaccine. \n But the researchers also found that the animals could become infected through their eyes, which means wearing a face mask may not be enough to protect people from the disease. \n Scientists around the world have been racing to develop a vaccine and the first clinical trials could be held in China and the US within a month. \n But a number of cases, where people who had tested negative for the disease and were discharged from hospital only to give a positive result a few days later, have cast doubt on the process. \n The rate of reoccurrence ranged from 0.1 to 1 per cent nationwide, according to China\u2019s state media reports. However, in some provinces such as Guangdong up to 14 per cent of the discharged patients had reportedly returned to hospital because of the test results. \n If it turns out that these patients had been reinfected by the same virus, then vaccines will not prove effective. \n But the monkey experiment carried out by a team from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences may help dispel that fear. \n Details of the experiment were made available last Saturday (March 14) on bioRxiv, a website for studies pending peer review. \n Professor Qin Chuan wrote that his research team infected four rhesus monkeys with the Covid-19 strain and the animals started to show signs of sickness three days later. \n They developed a fever, started struggling to breath and lost their appetite and weight. \n On the seventh day of the experiment, Prof Qin euthanised one of the monkeys and found the virus had spread throughout its body from nose to bladder with visible damage to the lung tissues. \n The remaining monkeys, however, recovered gradually and eventually stopped showing symptoms. \n About a month later, after tests returned negative results and X-rays showed their internal organs had fully recovered, two monkeys were dosed with the virus through the mouth. \n The scientists recorded a temporary temperature rise, but other than that everything appeared to stay normal. \n Autopsies were performed on these two monkeys about two weeks later, and the researchers could not find a trace of the virus in their body. \n Meanwhile, very high antibody levels were detected after the second week, suggesting that the immune system was prepared to fight the disease. \n Prof Qin said the results would have \u201cimportant implications in evaluating vaccine development\u201d. \n The researchers argued that the positive test on some recovered patients may be down to some other cause rather than the patients becoming reinfected. \n \u201cIt may be attributed to \u2018false negative\u2019\u2026 test results before their discharge or the patients not making a full recovery even though they meet the criteria for a discharge,\u201d they wrote. \n The animal experiment supports observations made by some doctors on the front line in the fight against the disease. \n Professor Zhong Nanshan , a leading government scientist, said in Guangzhou last week that they had found a strong presence of antibodies in recovered patients, which meant the virus could no longer use them as a carrier again. \n \u201cNow the question everyone cares about is whether the close contacts and family members may be infected because (the patient) tested positive again. So far I have not seen any evidence,\u201d Zhong said. \n Nonetheless, the government has taken precautions. From March 5, all patients discharged from hospitals need to stay in a quarantine facility for another two weeks. \n A doctor, who works at a public hospital in Beijing looking after Covid-19 patients, said the experiment provided valuable information because monkeys are genetically close to humans but \u201cwhat happens on monkeys does not always work on us\u201d. \n The doctor also said that a recent case in Japan has caused \u201csome concerns in medical circles\u201d after the health authorities reported that a 70-year-old patient who had recovered was hospitalised again for developing Covid-19 symptoms such as fever and difficulty breathing. \n In a separate experiment involving three monkeys, Prof Qin and colleagues also found evidence to suggest people could be infected through the eyes. \n Dr Wang Guangfa, a senior medical expert from Beijing, was infected after a trip to Wuhan to investigate the early outbreak despite wearing a face mask and other protective gear. \n Dr Wang suspected that the virus entered into his body through the eyes as he wiped sweat from his forehead, but had no evidence to support the theory. \n He later recovered at home in Beijing with relatively mild symptoms. \n To verify the theory, Prof Qin and colleagues dropped a solution containing the virus into two monkeys\u2019 eyes. \n To their surprise, the researchers did not find the virus on the surface of the monkeys\u2019 eyes the next day. But several days later, both animals tested positive. \n Further investigations showed that the viral strain might have landed on the conjunctiva, a tissue lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white of the eye, and then travelled through the tear duct before ending up in the upper throat. \n However, the infection suffered by the monkeys appeared to be less severe than that of another animal that had caught the virus through the throat, according to another paper posted by Prof Qin on bioRxiv last Saturday. \n According to several other recent studies, the new coronavirus can survive in the air or on metal surfaces for days. \n The scientists wrote that their findings suggested that people should be more aware of the need to protect their eyes. \n They argued transmission could be cut by \u201cregular hand-washing in daily life and wearing protective eyewear when in close contact with patients or in crowded places, especially for clinicians\u201d. SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST "}, {"content": "China's controversial quarantine measures worked, prominent epidemiologist argues. BEIJING (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - China's controversial quarantine measures limited the size of the country's Covid-19 outbreak and should be kept in place until late April, according to a study by a prominent Chinese epidemiologist. \n The study, led by Dr Zhong Nanshan, who has spearheaded China's effort against Covid-19, was published last month in China's Journal of Thoracic Disease, of which he is editor-in-chief. It defended various measures taken by China since late January to control the spread of the virus, including citywide lockdowns, forced quarantines and shutdowns of public transportation. \n Critics have charged that these moves were ineffective, violate the rights of individuals, and were too late to materialise after the discovery of the virus, and initial efforts to warn the public of its danger were suppressed. \n Yet Dr Zhong argued that these measures managed to quickly reduce the number of new cases. The study said that they also cut both the number of peak \"active infections,\" which refers to the number of people ill at the height of a region's epidemic, and the predicted total number of infections by the end of the epidemic. \n Nevertheless, at a Feb 27 press conference in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong province, Dr Zhong said that the paper had been rejected by at least one \"authoritative\" overseas medical journal, though he did not say which or why. \n Using a version of the \"susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered\" mathematical modelling technique, the study predicted that with the quarantine measures in force at the time of its publication, the epidemic in China would peak on Feb 28 with 59,764 cumulative active infections, dwindle by late April and result in about 122,122 cases in total by the end of the epidemic. \n This contrasts with modelling done by overseas infectious disease experts, with one study estimating the country's Covid-19 cases would reach 160,000 by early February. While Dr Zhong's figures more closely match China's official case numbers, Caixin has previously reported that the official tally excludes a significant portion of people who have tested positive for Covid-19, namely those without symptoms. \n According to Dr Zhong's team, a five-day delay in implementing the country's various lockdowns would have tripled the total number of infections in the country. Taken five days earlier, the measures would have cut the number of cases nationwide by two-thirds. \n Meanwhile the paper predicted that infections in Hubei, the province hardest hit by the outbreak, would peak on Feb 20 at 42,792 cases, then grow to a total of 59,578 by late April, when the outbreak is expected to near its end. \n Had interventions been delayed, both Hubei's active infections and total cases would have been over 2.6 times the current projected amount. Had the interventions been introduced five days earlier, the epidemic peak should have arrived five days earlier, with the total case number not exceeding 25,000. \n The study argues that if Hubei had ended its restrictions on movement after the extended Chinese New Year holiday concluded in early February, the province would have had a second peak in infections in March. \n The authors found similar trends for Guangdong and Zhejiang, two other provinces hit hard by the virus. \n \"The continued policy of 'early detection' and subsequent isolation might be effective in preventing a second epidemic wave in Guangdong and Zhejiang,\" the study said. \n The paper cautions that the return of migrants to Chinese cities, broadened testing and climate factors could affect the number of cases and that \"the policy of strict monitoring and early detection should remain in place until the end of April 2020.\" \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global.

China announced the closure of its side of the mountain on Thursday.  \n It is the second time in recent years that the climbing season has been disrupted. Expeditions were suspended in 2015 after a major earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 that year, killing some 9,000 people.  \n Eighteen people were killed at the Everest base camp when an avalanche triggered by the quake roared down a slope.  \n \"This is disappointing news for both our expedition leaders and our clients who have trained for months for this year\u2019s climb,\" Lukas Furtenbach, of the California-based guiding company Furtenbach Adventure, said.  \n Adrian Ballinger of the Alpenglow Expeditions company said he understood the decision.  \n \u201cWhile cancelling a climb is never an outcome we want, this time, it\u2019s the responsible thing to do,\u201d Ballinger said in a statement.  \n \u201cA COVID-19 outbreak at base camp would be dangerous and potentially devastating,\u201d he said.  \n Nepal would also stop issuing visas on arrival until April 30, an official said.  \n (This story corrects term COVID in penultimate paragraph.)

GENEVA/DUBAI - All countries need to prepare to combat the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, as authorities raced to contain the epidemic's rapid global spread and Wall Street looked set for its biggest weekly fall since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  \n With new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even rich nations should prepare.  \n \"No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,\" Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe's worst outbreak.  \n In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and cancelled big gatherings, including sports events, to try to halt spread of the flu-like disease known as COVID-19 that emerged in central China more than two months ago from an illegal wildlife market.  \n The death rate appears to be around 2 percent, although it could be lower if there are many mild, undiagnosed cases, experts say.  \n By comparison, seasonal influenza has a case fatality rate of around 0.1%, said Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ahead of a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, who has been put in charge of coordinating the U.S. response.  \n \"So therefore you have somewhat of a serious potential for morbidity and mortality,\" he said, adding, \"We're dealing with a serious virus.\"  \n There is particular concern over a case in Japan in which a woman tested positive for the virus for a second time. Second positive tests have also been reported in China and could imply contracting the disease does not confer immunity. Scientists warned that much remains unknown about this new virus.  \n The head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said discussions were being held with organizers about the fate of the 2020 Olympics, scheduled for July in Tokyo, although no decision was expected soon.  \n Their cancellation or relocation would be a massive blow for Japan, which said it was closing its entire school system for the next month in a bid to prevent spread of the virus.  \n The virus has so far mainly battered China, causing nearly 80,000 infections and more than 2,700 deaths, according to WHO figures. It has spread to another 46 countries, where around 3,700 cases and 57 deaths have been reported.  \n \"This virus has pandemic potential,\" Tedros told reporters in Geneva.

An epidemic is on its way,\" Macron said.  \n Germany, too, has warned of an impending epidemic. And Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East and beyond, announced tighter border controls.  \n There is no cure for the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop.  \n  \n MISINFORMATION 'EPIDEMIC'  \n Iran extended closures of cinemas, cultural events and conferences for another week and called off Friday prayers in some cities.  \n The WHO's Ryan said Iran's outbreak may be worse than realized. It has suffered the highest death toll outside China, with 26 dead, suggesting there are likely many more cases than the 245 reported, which includes some senior officials.  \n Italy, desperate to stave off a probable recession, warned that an \"epidemic of misleading information\" could do worse harm than the virus itself.  \n The coronavirus has played havoc with global aviation and tourism as airlines cancel flights, countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel.  \n Chinese authorities said the number of new deaths there stood at 29, its lowest daily tally since Jan. 28.

Everybody is so done with life and sorry for making it worse, but we are just in the second day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown in India. But let's get this straight. There is really no other option at the moment. However, we can tell you something that might cheer you up even in this grim period.\nYou've read about Survival Of The Fittest enough and it is time to implement it now. Why? Because we have to survive this pandemic without any sort of help. For those living alone, especially. It is taxing because there is literally no help. You need to fend for your food, clean the house and do other chores after completing your shift. On the flipside though, did you ever think about the amount of money that you are saving while cribbing about the lockdown?\nThe silver lining, thus, on this cloud, is that if not anything else, you will walk out of this pandemic with some extra bucks in your bank account once the corona conundrum is done with.\nFor the sake of your sanity (and ours as well), we curated this list that will help you ascertain a rough estimate of the amount of money you are saving at the moment.\nTake a look:\nNO ZOMATO, NO SWIGGY\nYes, this is the worst thing about the lockdown. Not being able to order food online. Basically, coronavirus has ensured that even in this distressing situation, you cannot afford to feel bad for yourself and soothe your soul with some biryani, pizza or tandoori chicken for that matter. You just have to make do with ready-to-eat jazz or better still, cook for yourself. But thanks to Zomato and Swiggy stalling operations, you cannot even believe the amount of money you are saving. Come on, you know it. Till then, enjoy simple home-cooked food and you can gorge on Swiggy and Zomato once we are done with the pandemic.\nNO ONLINE SHOPPING\nWe understand it's frustrating not being able to shop online considering some people actually keep a part of their earnings aside every month to do this. None of the e-commerce websites are delivering stuff but look at the brighter side of the story. You can use all the money that you had kept aside to shop tons of stuff once services resume. Think about the fact that you will not have to choose between the white shirt or that red lipstick - you can actually just buy both without batting an eyelid.\nNO CONVEYANCE EXPENSES\nCab aggregators Uber and Ola have suspended their services and public transport isn't available as well. Moreover, you are working from home and aren't even stepping out for recreation. So, no expenses for conveyance either. Make no mistake, because you are saving big time here.\nNO RECREATIONAL EXPENSES\nWhen was the last time you opened your wardrobe and wore a fancy dress for an outing? Well, the answer should explain that our only outing has been from the bedroom to the kitchen and vice-versa and that too, in our pyjamas. No partying with friends. No shopping at malls or indulging in delectable dishes at restaurants. Nothing, actually. Right now, it is all about you and your tanhai, and not to forget, kaafi saara paisa in the bank account.\nBEST USE OF RESOURCES\nIn order to avoid stepping out, it is ideal to make do with what you have. Everybody is basically making the best use of their resources, and although grocery stores are open, you are reconsidering heading out until absolutely necessary. With that, you are actually cutting out on a lot of unnecessary expenses. Do the math.\nSo, don't be surprised with your increased bank balance.

As of Wednesday, Singapore had 266 confirmed cases and no deaths from the virus.\nAs new infections increased, the government tightened quarantine controls.\nTaiwan, a self-governed island off the coast of mainland China, has confirmed just 77 cases and one death. Most recent cases were residents returning from overseas travel.\nHong Kong has reported 167 cases and four deaths. Its leader, Carrie Lam, on Tuesday warned against all outbound travel and said any people arriving from outside greater China will face 14-day home quarantines or medical surveillance.\nOf the 13 cases found in the tiny gambling enclave of Macao, 10 have recovered. Casinos have been closed for weeks to battle the outbreak.\nCambodia, which has confirmed a dozen cases, last weekend moved to stop foreigners traveling from France, the U.S., Spain, Germany, Italy and Iran after several new cases were found among travelers.\nThailand, likewise, appears to have kept cases under control with aggressive public health campaigns intended to minimize infections, though new cases jumped recently as stepped-up testing found clusters linked to a boxing tournament and an evening gathering at a bar. So far, 177 cases have been confirmed among 70 million Thais, even though it's a top destination for travelers, especially from China.\nAssuming the numbers reported to the World Health Organization are accurate, many of the countries with lower caseloads are relatively isolated geographically: Singapore, New Zealand, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia. Some others may be latecomers in testing and reporting: Russia , Indonesia, Vietnam.\nFor Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the experience of battling the 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected some 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, helped ensure residents took the risks seriously, experts say.\n\"Almost everyone played ball and followed accordingly,\" said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. \"SARS was our baptism by fire and we were forced to learn everything by swimming in the deep end of the pool.\"\nAfter the SARS outbreak, when 238 people were infected and 33 died in Singapore, the city revamped its already excellent health care system, writing up new protocols for containing outbreaks. It set up \"fever centers\" to isolate suspected cases, invested in equipment and improved training in handling infectious diseases, Leong said. So when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered, Singapore was ready to act, he said.\nFrom Feb. 1, Singapore blocked entry and transit for new visitors who had traveled to mainland China within 14 days. These restrictions have since expanded to include visitors with recent travel to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea.\nWhen the number of local cases without links to previous cases or travel in China surged, the government raised its alert to \"orange,\" the second-highest level, on Feb. 7. The Singapore Air Show, a huge event that draws thousands, scaled back the number of participants and barred most exhibitors and visitors from China from attending. Good hygiene and avoiding handshakes were recommended.\nThe National Public Health Laboratory, set up after SARS, was prepared to fast-track testing, using advanced diagnostics and newly developed COVID-19 test kits.\nRapid testing and isolation of suspected cases, and painstaking tracing of contacts, helped by police, surveillance videos and ATM records, have helped prevent a worse local outbreak, said Tikki Pangestu, a visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former director of WHO's research policy and cooperation department.\nOnce a COVID-19 case is confirmed, Singapore embarks on \"diligent contract tracing,\" said Pangestu. It ordered workers arriving from countries with endemic virus infections to stay home. Worship services were suspended in favor of livestreaming after a cluster was found at a church. Schools suspended mass assemblies and staggered recess.\nSo far, 5,700 people have been quarantined.\nIn Thailand, too, public health workers have gone door-to-door to track down contacts, said Thanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department of the Health Ministry. \"We must go see them ourselves. This is an old public health way. We do our best,\" he said.\nIt has mostly worked. But newly confirmed clusters show one dinner, one boxing match or one religious gathering can undo weeks of work.\nInitially, Germany was thought to have done relatively well at slowing the spread, but infections there have jumped to 9,360.\nIn South Korea, where more than 270,000 people have been tested, newly discovered cases are dropping sharply, but clusters are still popping up, at a call center, at a church.\nThis week, Malaysia has reported a surge in cases linked to a religious gathering in its capital last week. Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia also have confirmed new cases linked to that gathering.\nIt's unclear if the strategies used in an authoritarian society like Singapore would work in bigger countries whose citizens expect greater personal freedoms: In March, a Chinese couple was charged under Singapore's Infectious Diseases Act for misinforming health officials and obstructing contact tracing. If convicted, they may be imprisoned or fined.\nBut as virus controls expand to unprecedented levels in many other countries, the policies are looking prescient.\nSingapore is a small island with strong public trust in the government, \"a strong healthcare system, excellent information systems and plenty of money,\" said Pangestu. \"Many other countries, especially developing ones, do not have these capacities or characteristics.\"\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, lauded for adopting a calming, clear approach early on, said in a televised talk last week that the situation was under control but the government was planning ahead, trying to free up hospital beds to be prepared for any surge in cases.\nSingaporeans \"feel we are all in this together,\" Lee said, \"and we don't leave anyone behind.\" "}, {"content": "Young disabled dies in China after his father is quarantined due to coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US will begin screening passengers on Friday (Jan 17) arriving from a Chinese city at the heart of a mysterious Sars-linked virus, officials said, after an outbreak that has stricken dozens claimed a second life. \n Three confirmed cases, meanwhile, have now been reported outside China - two in Thailand and one in Japan - even as health authorities around the world sought to assure the public that the overall risk of infection remained low. \n Martin Cetron, a senior official at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters: \"To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this novel coronavirus, CDC is beginning entry screening at three ports of entry.\" \n These are San Francisco airport and New York's JFK, which both receive direct flights, as well as Los Angeles, the biggest destination for connecting flights, he said, adding: \"We're expecting that the screening over the next couple of weeks could include as many as 5000 people\" beginning Friday night. \n Incoming travellers will be asked to fill out a questionnaire and submit to a temperature check, with those showing possible signs of infection sent on to another facility for a diagnostic test that could take up to a day. \n The move came after Chinese officials said the infection had claimed its second death: a 69-year-old man who died on Wednesday in Wuhan, the central Chinese city believed to be the epicentre of an outbreak of the pathogen from the same family as the deadly Sars virus. \n No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan's health commission has said the possibility \"cannot be excluded.\" \n The enigmatic illness has caused alarm because of its connection to Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Pneumonia linked to the new virus has hit at least 41 people in China, with the outbreak centered around a seafood market in Wuhan. \n Of these 12 have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the Wuhan health commission, while five others are in a serious condition. \n The second man to die became sick on Dec 31 and his condition worsened two weeks ago, it said, with the disease causing pulmonary tuberculosis and damage to multiple organ functions. \n Thailand reported its second case of the coronavirus on Friday: a 74-year-old Chinese woman who had arrived from Wuhan earlier this week. \n Her condition is improving, said Thai health officials, who urged people not to panic as there was \"no spread of the virus\" in the South-east Asian country. \n That sentiment was echoed by senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier, who said: \"For families sitting around the dinner table tonight, this is not something that they generally need to worry about.\" \n Yet, much remains to be understood about the \"2019 novel coronavirus\" or \"2019-nCoV,\" according to the CDC, which added that \"there are indications that some limited person-to-person spread may have occurred.\" \n The latest fatality comes as China prepares for its busiest travel season of the year next week, when millions of people take buses, trains and planes for Chinese New Year. \n China has not announced any travel restrictions but authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers. \n The Wuhan health commission said one man who had been diagnosed worked at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but his wife, who also had the virus, reported \"no history of exposure\" at the facility. \n The first case in Thailand had not reported visiting the seafood market, the WHO said Tuesday. The woman was reported to be in a stable condition earlier this week. \n The patient in Japan, who was released from hospital, had also not visited the market. Japanese officials said it was possible that the man had been in contact with a person infected with the virus while in Wuhan. \n After the second death was reported, online discussion spread in China over the severity of the Wuhan coronavirus - and how much information the government is hiding from the public. \n Several complained about censorship of online posts, while others made comparisons to 2003, when Beijing drew criticism from the WHO for under-reporting the number of Sars cases. \n \"It's so strange,\" wrote a web user on the social media platform Weibo, citing the overseas cases in Japan and Thailand. \"They all have Wuhan pneumonia cases but (in China) we don't have any infections outside of Wuhan - is that scientific?\" \n But the CDC's Messonnier thanked her Chinese counterparts for quickly identifying the pathogen and making its genome publicly available to scientists around the world, allowing them to rapidly develop diagnostic tools.

All public hospital emergency departments here are in \"outbreak response mode\" as Singapore raises its defences against a mysterious, Sars-like virus that is spreading in China. \n \"We cannot rule out the possibility that the new (Wuhan) virus will reach Singapore,\" Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), told The Straits Times. The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be properly cleaned before it is used again. \n At the NCID, the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. \n Prof Leo said the NCID has \"high-end\" Hepa filters in 124 negative pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses. \n As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n It will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. If that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. That takes 24 hours. \n Prof Leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human. \n Four types cause the common cold and are mild. The other two are the more dangerous Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the bug, currently called the 2019-nCoV. \n Prof Leo said that it is not yet known whether this virus is as dangerous as Sars. \n But Singapore is not taking chances. All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE). Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. \n Prof Leo said Singapore has a stockpile of the disposable PPE as well as the powered air purifying respirators - enough to supply all hospitals should a major outbreak occur here. \"Yes it is expensive, but protection of staff is the most important thing,\" said Prof Leo, a veteran of the Sars outbreak in 2003, when medical staff caring for infected patients were among the 238 people infected and the 33 who died. \n The 330-bed NCID , which opened slightly over a year ago, has more than 100 \"surge beds\" which are kept empty and on standby for national emergencies. \n Although the flu vaccine does not protect against the Wuhan bug, she said it is a good idea to get vaccinated. On a national level, it will \"cut down on the background noise\". \n She added that should there be a positive case of the Wuhan bug here, people will be told. \n \"We need to be able to share the information and be able to guide the public, as well as the entire public healthcare system, to be able to handle the situation,\" she said. \n WIDER DEFINITION \n Singapore's Ministry of Health has widened its definition of suspect cases, and it will now include anyone with pneumonia who had been to China - not just Wuhan - within 14 days of the start of the illness. Anyone with acute respiratory infection who has been to any hospital in China within a fortnight of getting ill will also be treated as a suspect case. \n MORE SCREENINGS \n From today, Changi Airport will conduct temperature screening for all flights from China, and not just those from Wuhan. So far, all seven suspected cases in Singapore have proven not to have the Wuhan bug. \n SUSPECT CASES \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. At the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n GP DOCS ON THE WATCH \n All general practice doctors have been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients. \n SPECIAL AMBULANCES \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID.

"}, {"content": "covid-19 and climate change have a lot more in common than you think. Climate scientists tell us that climate change will not only bring about rising sea levels and more extreme weather events, it also increases the likelihood of epidemics. But despite the clear linkage between the two, our response to the current Covid-19 pandemic is almost completely opposite to our usual response to climate change. \n While the coronavirus can be fatal, the risk that one will die from the disease is (still) low. Nonetheless, governments in hard hit areas have acted promptly to declare \u201cwar\u201d on the pandemic while societies have made large sacrifices to contain the disease. \n With climate change, while the impacts are far greater in terms of loss of lives and risk to the very survival of the human species, mitigating climate change is seldom a priority in a government\u2019s resource allocation decisions. \n In short, we respond to epidemics (when they occur) with excessive fear and pessimism, even as we routinely discount the risks of, and are naively optimistic about, the very thing that makes them\u00a0more likely. \n In dealing with low-probability, high-dread events such as dying from Covid-19, we systemically overestimate our risks \u2014\u00a0much like how people overestimate their risks of dying in a terrorist attack or a plane crash relative to far more common causes of death. \n On the other hand, people and institutions underestimate the high (and increasing) risk of climate catastrophe. How do we explain this paradox? \n PROBABILITY NEGLECT, PRESENT BIAS AND GLOBAL COMMONS \n Our overestimation of risks linked to the coronavirus and our underestimation of climate risks are two sides of the same coin; they are explained by a bias called probability neglect. \n When dealing with risks (whether the risk of an epidemic or of climate change), we do not rely on actual probabilities but on how easily the risk comes to mind (saliency bias), our instincts, and our instant emotive reactions (the affect heuristic). \n The coronavirus is very salient; we are constantly inundated by news of it and daily updates of the numbers infected and dead around the world. It also evokes strong emotional reactions, especially fear. Salience combined with fear causes us to believe that something is far more probable than it is. \n Climate change is exactly the opposite. It is usually not salient as most people believe it will occur in some distant future. Climate change also does not evoke strong emotional responses in most people, except possibly for the young. Being an abstraction for most people, climate risks are systematically underestimated. \n The result of our collective fear is that governments prioritise the \u201cwar\u201d against the Covid-19 pandemic, often at the expense of other priorities. \n Global supply chains have also been disrupted; financial markets are roiled by the news of the disease spreading and of rising number of infections. \n The different responses to coronavirus and climate change also stem from what is known as present-biased preferences. People tend to overvalue immediate costs or benefits while discounting long-term impacts. \n In the case of the coronavirus , people are willing to make immediate sacrifices as there are short-term benefits, that of being protected from a potentially life-threatening disease.\u00a0 \n With climate change, people are reluctant to incur even small costs today because the benefits (such as the survival of mankind and preservation of the natural environment) are in the future and, therefore, heavily discounted.\u00a0 \n Climate change and epidemics are both problems of the global commons. Effective solutions require cooperation and coordination between governments.\u00a0 \n But such cooperation is difficult because every country has an incentive to free ride on the efforts of others. \n With epidemics, this free-rider problem is less pronounced as the domestic costs of an epidemic are high enough for most governments to take some preventive measures. \n With climate change, the free-rider problem (and the consequent tragedy of commons) seems more insurmountable. \n The benefits of not taking any climate action are internalised (that is, the benefits are fully captured by the country not taking climate action), while the costs to the global commons are externalised (that is, the costs are shared or distributed to the rest of the world). \n LESSONS FOR CLIMATE ACTION \n First, there is an opportunity for those of us who wish to see more resolute climate action to use the coronavirus crisis to emphasise the causal link between climate change and epidemics.\u00a0 \n Our message to governments and our fellow citizens should be: \u201cIf you do not wish to live with more of such viruses, we must take far more aggressive action on climate change.\u201d \n Second, there are many things governments can do to highlight the salience of climate risks. \n For example, just as the number of confirmed infections and deaths from the coronavirus has been highly visible, governments should also provide regular information on the costs and damages of climate change, as well as how these are expected to rise. \n Third, governments can take steps to counter our present bias. With the coronavirus, the benefits of governments taking aggressive action now are clear for all to see.\u00a0 \n With climate change, governments need to find ways to create a sense of crisis to persuade their populations that the costs of climate change are already upon us, and that the sacrifices needed to deal with it cannot be delayed anymore. \n Finally, the costs of climate change do not have to be fully internalised for countries to take action; they only need to be sufficiently internalised.\u00a0 \n That the coronavirus began in China, the fastest growing emitter of carbon emissions, also creates an opportunity for China to play a leadership role in climate change mitigation. By doing so, China would also reduce the risks of future epidemics. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Donald Low is senior lecturer and professor of practice in public policy at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where Xun Wu is professor and head of the Division of Public Policy.

The Chinese Embassy in Singapore has responded to an article written by veteran diplomat Bilahari Kausikan, which touched on how the Covid-19 outbreak starkly highlighted China's strengths and weaknesses. \n The article, which Mr Bilahari originally wrote for Canadian international affairs magazine Global Brief's blog, was reprinted in The Straits Times on Monday with the headline, \"China's inflection point and the CCP's fundamental dilemma\". \n The Chinese embassy spokesman said the article by Mr Bilahari, a former diplomat who is now chairman of the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore, was similar to the \"stereotype cliche of Western anti-China voices\" in its misinterpretation of China's political system and the leadership system under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). \n The spokesman said that at a difficult time when the Chinese people are making sacrifices to fight the Covid-19 outbreak, \"the sense of justice of the author to ideologically denigrate China and sell his long-held prejudice and even hostility towards China has to be questioned\". Whether a country's developmental strategy is right depends on that country's situation, said the spokesman, citing China's progress over the past 70 years to become the world's second-largest economy, and lifting over 800 million people out of poverty. \n Those achievements were made under the leadership of the CCP and the \"system of socialism with Chinese characteristics\", benefiting not just China but the rest of the world. \"Though Mr Bilahari himself did not deny China's great achievements, he still criticised the political system and the leadership system that created them. Actually it is logically self-contradictory,\" added the spokesman. \n He added that the country has united around the CCP Central Committee headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, its general secretary, since the 18th National Congress in 2012. \"China is striving hard to modernise the system and capacity for governance.

LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Here are some key features of viruses and the new coronavirus that was identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and is causing an outbreak of disease in China and beyond.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with \u201ccrown\u201d-like spikes.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Like other coronaviruses, the newly identified China coronavirus is being transmitted from person-to-person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Infection with the newly identified virus has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and there are limited accounts that it may also be spreading before symptoms show.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists say the scale of the current outbreak now points to \u201cself-sustaining\u201d human-to-human transmission. They estimate that each infected person is infecting, on average, two to three more people.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggest the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a \u201crecombinant\u201d virus strain.

Health officials have warned that the Wuhan outbreak has reached a \"critical stage\", as the virus mutates and the outbreak continues to spread to more provinces, territories and countries. \n The United States and Macau registered their first cases yesterday, while infected people have been identified for the first time in Hainan, Fujian, Liaoning and Anhui, widening the number of affected provinces to more than 20. \n Hong Kong reported that a man had preliminarily tested positive for the virus, but a final test result would be known only today. \n The authorities fear the number of cases will soar as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel across or out of the country during the Chinese New Year holidays. \n The death toll climbed to 17 and, as of last night, at least 540 people have tested positive for the 2019-nCoV virus, which scientists have determined is part of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) family. \n The National Health Commission's emergency management office director Xu Shuqiang said the country is at a critical stage in its battle to stop the viral outbreak from turning into a pandemic. \n The virus is believed to have originated from wild animals sold illegally at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei province, where the first wave of patients had worked at, said virologist Gao Fu. \n \"From animal to human, the virus has adapted and evolved. The relationship between viruses and humans is like a cat and mouse game,\" said Professor Gao, who is director-general of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. \n While experts said the biggest worry is the emergence of super-spreaders, Prof Gao said there is no evidence of these highly infectious individuals yet, even though 14 healthcare workers were infected by one single carrier in Wuhan. \n The World Health Organisation identifies a super-spreader as someone who infects more than 10 secondary contacts. \n \"We will be monitoring closely because there is the possibility of super-spreaders,\" said Prof Gao. \n Wuhan Mayor Zhang Xianwang said the 14 healthcare workers - a doctor and 13 nurses - were infected by a patient in a neurosurgery ward who had not been tested for the new coronavirus. He developed a fever only after his surgery. \n \"That was a very profound lesson,\" said Mr Zhang, who has appealed to people not to travel in or out of the city. \n More than 90 per cent of the infection cases have been in Wuhan. The central Chinese city of 11 million has been on high alert as the authorities step up checks on travellers and vehicles. \n All trading of wildlife has been banned, and restaurants have been prohibited from serving dishes with the animals. \n News that the disease is now being spread through human contact sent jitters across cities, as people rushed out to buy face masks and disinfectants. Phar-macies in Beijing and Shanghai ran low on stocks, especially after the country launched a nationwide hygiene campaign. \n Beijing-based insurance agent Kevin Tu, 40, was bent on going home to Wuhan today to spend the new year with his parents. But he sought a refund for his air ticket yesterday after his parents insisted that he stay put in the capital city. \n \"They were worried about my safety, but I am worried about theirs too. I have told them to stay home as much as possible, and to avoid crowded places,\" Mr Tu, an only child, told The Straits Times. \n On Monday, the health commission upgraded the Wuhan pneumonia to a Class B infectious disease, which puts it in the same category as Sars. But it is handling the outbreak with stricter measures under a Class A category, which stipulates that an infection anywhere in the country must be reported within two hours. \n The Class A classification also allows for greater resources to be mobilised. \n Ms Jiao Yahui, a health commission official, said while there are hospitals currently designated for treating the pneumonia patients, the authorities' contingency plans include backup hospitals in case the epidemic becomes widespread. \n Front-line medical workers including Chinese traditional medi-cine practitioners in Beijing told ST that they have been made to cancel their Chinese New Year leave to be on standby since Tuesday. \n Hospitals in the capital city have set up pre-screening triages, and suspected cases are transferred to fever clinics. \"We just hope this battle will pass soon,\" said Chinese traditional medicine physician Jia Xiaoming, 30.

Amid the coronavirus alarm, the sale of N95 face masks has soared in Delhi, triggering a massive shortage of the protective gear and a rise in its price in many areas.\nThe masks have vanished from the medical stores in some places including those around RML Hospital where the number of patients under observation rose to six on Monday. Another eight patients have tested negative and they have been discharged.\nWhere masks are still available, in Connaught Place, for instance, long queues formed at the stores. Customers were also seen snapping up hand sanitisers and thermometers.\nShops that have run out of N95 masks have no idea as to when their next delivery would arrive. Vendors of medical supplies said that masks were becoming harder to source. Uttam, a medical store owner near RML Hospital, confirmed that there has been a surge in the demand for masks after coronavirus cases were reported in India. \"We have sold around 10,000 masks in a week. These include both N95 and surgical masks. N95s are out of stock at the moment,\" he said.\nPawan, another medical store owner near RML Hospital, admitted that the increase in demand has spiked prices. \"A plain mask which used to cost Rs 5 is now being sold at Rs 10. Also, we used to buy one N95 for Rs 100. Now we're not getting it even for Rs 150,\" he said.\nMedical supply vendors said people who cannot get N95 masks are buying regular ones. However, according to Dr Sandeep Nayar, HOD, Respiratory Medicine, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, regular masks do not protect people from the Chinese virus.\n\"Only special masks like N95 or N99 can prevent coronavirus infection. These too should be tightly worn. Mouth and nose should be properly covered,\" he said.\nLast week, India banned exports of all kinds of personal protection equipment, including masks. The move aims at meeting the rising demand for such products.\nTHE EXPORT BAN \nOn Friday, the All India Food and Drug Licence Association (AFDLH) had sought a ban on the export of surgical and N95 masks as they were not available in local markets.\n\"Manufacturers are getting huge orders for these masks which are being sold for 10-times more than their actual price. Due to this, Indian citizens will find it difficult to get these masks when needed. Hence the export and the price of these masks should be controlled,\" AFDLH had written to the government.\n\"Given the high and lucrative demand internationally, manufacturers are ignoring the need in local markets and were busy in meeting the export demands. These trade activities had put Indians at the risk of not getting the masks to be safe from this virus. So, we demanded the government to ban its export and regulate the prices,\" said Abhay Pande, president, AFDLH.\nThe N95 respirator is designed to fit very closely to the face and, as a result, more efficiently filters airborne particles. The N95 face mask is available online but delivery can take up to two weeks , making it a less feasible option for customers.\nAt a high-level meeting on Monday, Health Ministry officials said that adequate materials like personal protection equipment (PPE) and N95 masks are available and the Centre is closely monitoring the situation in all states and Union Territories. coronavirus causes a flu-like severe respiratory ailment and can spread from person to person by airborne droplets that an infected person expels when sneezing or coughing.\n\"One must avoid direct contact with those suspected to have been infected by coronavirus. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose if you have not washed your hands properly. Cover your face while coughing or sneezing with a tissue,\" Nayar said.\nCENTRAL GOVT SWINGS INTO ACTION \nMeanwhile, a Group of Ministers (GoM) was formed on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It held a meeting to review the preparedness to contain the spread of the virus in the country. The GoM includes Union ministers Harsh Vardhan, Hardeep Singh Puri, S Jaishankar, G Kishan Reddy, Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Mansukh Lal Mandaviya.\nThe ministers were apprised of the three confirmed cases reported from Kerala and the preventive steps and measures taken to contain coronavirus.\nThe GoM also took note of the government announcing a temporary suspension of the e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in the neighbouring country and a fresh advisory saying anyone with travel history to China since January 15 can be quarantined.\nThe government has also advised that people having compelling reasons to visit India should contact the Indian embassy in Beijing or consulate in Shanghai or Guangzhou.\nSo far 645 people have been transported to India from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. They have been admitted to quarantine centres of the Army and the ITBP in and around the National Capital.\nTests conducted for coronavirus on 406 people, who were evacuated to Delhi from China's Wuhan city to an ITBP facility in Chhawla area, have been negative till now, a senior official of the border guarding force said. The Kerala government has declared the coronavirus epidemic as a state calamity with a third student testing positive for the infection in the state. The decision was taken at the apex committee of the State Disaster Management Authority chaired by Chief Secretary Tom Jose. Two earlier positive cases, also of students who came back from Wuhan, were reported from Thrissur and Alapuzha districts.\nMeanwhile, the death toll in China soared to 425 with 64 deaths on Monday while the number of confirmed cases climbed to 20,400, Chinese health officials announced on Monday.

SINGAPORE \u2014 The Covid-19 disease appears to be \u201ccontainable\u201d based on the measures that some countries, including Singapore, have taken to combat the coronavirus outbreak, even though much is still unknown about it, said the director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health (MOH). \n \u201cChina, Hong Kong, Singapore have (put in place) quite a few different measures and different styles of containment, and they seem to be reducing the number of new cases. \n \u201cSo perhaps it is not quite as transmissible as influenza,\u201d Dr Vernon Lee said on Tuesday (Feb 25) at a panel discussing how Singapore has responded to the Covid-19 outbreak so far.\u00a0\u00a0 \n However, he stressed repeatedly that more time is needed to understand the transmission and the severity characteristics of Covid-19.\u00a0 \n \u201cTime will tell. I think we still need to learn more about this disease.\u201d \n Dr Lee, who is also an adjunct associate professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, was one of four panellists at the discussion organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and streamed live on its Facebook page. \n The others were economist Barnabas Gan from the United Overseas Bank (UOB); Dr Carol Soon, senior research fellow at IPS; and Dr Shashi Jayakumar, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). \n They delved into how Singapore has dealt with the medical, economic, and social impact of the public health emergency. \n Dr Lee was asked by Dr Gillian Koh, moderator and deputy director of research at IPS, to give his take on how medical science and epidemiologists around the world are dealing with the new coronavirus, which had its first outbreak in Wuhan of China\u2019s Hubei province in December last year. \n In response, he said it is unprecedented the way in which the amount of information known about Covid-19 has ballooned in the past two months, but there are still several unknowns.\u00a0 \n \u201cIt is a battle against nature, and with time, some of these answers will be clearer.\u201d \n When it came to establishing the mortality rate of the disease, for example, it is challenging to detect milder cases of Covid-19, which may also skew the statistics on case fatality rates by several magnitudes, he said. \n In Singapore, more than 10 per cent of Covid-19 cases have been admitted to the intensive care unit, which \u201cis certainly concerning\u201d, Dr Lee said. \n \u201cBecause of the sheer number of people that are affected across the globe, (Covid-19) still caused many deaths. So we do not want to trivialise any virus because it has some potential impact.\u201d \n  From left: Dr Gillian Koh, Dr Vernon Lee, Mr Barnabas Gan,\u00a0Dr Carol Soon and Dr Shashi Jayakumar at a panel discussion organised by the Institute of Policy Studies.\u00a0Photo: Institute of Policy Studies, National University of Singapore \u00a0 \n TOURISM LOSS COULD WIPE OUT 2020 ECONOMIC GAINS \n Since the time needed to fully learn about Covid-19 may be protracted , the economic impact of this disease can be significant, considering that Singapore\u2019s economy was affected only across a single quarter during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in 2003, Mr Gan\u00a0said. \n Before the outbreak arrived in Singapore, UOB predicted that Singapore\u2019s economy would grow by 1.5 per cent this year. \n However, current economic figures now point to a 25 to 30 per cent fall in tourism arrivals, which could work out to a S$6.8 billion to S$8.1 billion fall in tourism receipts this year due to the viral outbreak, he said. This is equivalent to the 1.5 per cent growth that UOB predicted earlier for 2020. \n \u201cThat will completely wipe out our GDP (gross domestic product) and bring it to around 0.5 per cent, just based on how much our tourism receipts actually fall,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n Dr Koh noted that the fall could be greater, given the impact on other non-tourism sectors such as aviation, manufacturing, retail, and food-and-beverage. She asked Mr Gan whether the measures announced during Budget 2020 were\u00a0enough to bolster Singapore through this period. \n In his Budget speech last week, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat had announced that the Government will set aside a total of S$6.4 billion to help workers, firms, households and frontline agencies tackle Covid-19. \n Mr Gan said some people have noted that a few measures came with a short time span, such as the three-month period for the Jobs Support Scheme to help companies retain workers, but the Government has around S$8 billion more up its sleeve in accumulated surpluses during the current term of government. This\u00a0kitty could be used to \u201cpush up\u201d the economy if needed, he said. \n SINGAPOREANS HAVE TO FACE A \u2018SLOW-BURN\u2019 CRISIS \n On how the people here have reacted, Dr Soon and Dr Jayakumar said that Singaporeans need to be able to prepare emotionally for health pandemics, which Dr Jayakumar described as a \u201cslow-burn\u201d crisis. \n Dr Soon noted that three types of misinformation emerged during this outbreak. These are factual misinformation, such as the false rumours of MRT station closures; misleading advisories such as unproven home remedies being shared online; and xenophobic, racist sentiments that have no basis in fact, which are observed both overseas and in Singapore. \n She said that Singapore has been effective in trying to plug information gaps about the virus through \u201ca very interesting and relatively efficacious playbook\u201d.\u00a0 \n Besides daily updates about the spread of the virus, the Government reinforces key messages through different channels, such as through various government ministries, the media, and experts to help people dissect the situation. \n It has also wielded the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) to counter Covid-19 falsehoods in a way that most people agree with, she said. \n Government spokespersons were also quick to counter rumours, she added, noting how Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had come out at one point to categorically refute talk that the authorities were going to raise the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition from Orange level to Red. \n Still, more can be done, she said. While the Government has been providing updates usually at a certain time each day, on some days, the information may arrive later in the evening. This may create suspicions, Dr Soon said. \n \u201cWhere there is an information gap, people will rely on heuristics \u2014 mental shortcuts \u2014 to plug the gaps,\u201d she added.\u00a0 \n Dr Jayakumar said that while Singapore is prepared for one-off incidents such as terrorist attacks, the Government, academics and think-tanks should do more to look at how the country can bounce back from slow-burn crises such as pandemics and climate change. \n \u201cIn my point of view, it is almost problematic that Singapore is so safe, clean and secure. It is not normal... it is supernormal, because almost nothing of note, security-wise, seems to happen in Singapore.\u00a0 \n \u201cNow we have to accept that these things may be there for a long time,\u201d Dr Jayakumar said.

The Center for Disease Control says on its website the virus had links to a \"seafood\u00a0and live animal market\" where a human might have contracted the virus from an animal. The virus then spread person-to-person (  here  ). The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, tiredness, cough, and shortness of breath that can appear  two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus (  here  ). The coronavirus is spread person-to-person (  here  ).\nMobile phones use radio waves. They send and receive radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs).\u00a05G uses \"beam-forming technology\", which allows radiofrequency electromagnetic fields to go directly where needed (  here  ).\nThe International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) after 7 years of research released 2020 guidelines on limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields.\u00a0They\u00a0include information about 5G.\nThe commission says the main effect that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields have on the human body is increased temperature of exposed tissue. The body can handle small increases to body temperature, such as through exercising, but radiofrequency exposure and increased temperature can be dangerous above a certain threshold (  here  ).\nAccording to the ICNIRP,\u00a0\"Another general characteristic of RF EMFs is that the higher the frequency, the lower the depth of penetration of the EMFs into the body. As 5G technologies can utilize higher EMF frequencies (>24 GHz) in addition to those currently used (<4 GHz), power from those higher frequencies will be primarily absorbed more superficially than that from previous mobile telecommunications technologies [\u2026] Accordingly, 5G exposures will not cause any harm providing that they adhere to the ICNIRP (2020) guidelines\" (  here  ).\nEric van Rongen, Chairman of ICNIRP, said in a video that there is no evidence that electromagnetic fields cause health effects such as cancer, electrohypersensitivity, infertility or anything else. The only two recognized health effects are nerve stimulation in up to 10 MHz and heating from 100 kHz (  here  ).\nThe World Health Organization says no research has linked exposure to wireless technology with negative health effects (  here  ).

Moody's on Monday slashed India's growth forecast for 2020 to 5.4 per cent from 6.6\u00a0per cent projected earlier, on slower than expected economic recovery.\n\nIn its update on Global Macro Outlook, Moody's Investors Service said India's economy has decelerated rapidly over the last 2 years and economic recovery is likely to be 'shallow'.\n\"While the economy may well begin to recover in the current quarter, we expect any recovery to be slower than we had previously expected. Accordingly, we have revised our growth forecasts to 5.4 per cent for 2020 and 5.8 per cent for 2021, down from our previous projections of 6.6 per cent\u00a0and 6.7 per cent respectively,\" Moody's said.\nMoody's growth projections are based on calendar year and as per its estimates, India's GDP grew 5 per cent in 2019.\nThe rating agency had in November 2019 projected India\u2019s economic growth in 2020 and 2021 at 6.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively.\nIn its latest update, Moody's said the reduction in India's growth rate reflects domestic challenges rather than external factors.\nStating that the key to stronger economic momentum would be the revival of domestic demand and bank credit growth, Moody's said the Union Budget 2020 did not contain a significant stimulus to address the demand slump.\nWith a weak economy and depressed credit growth reinforcing each other, Moody's said, \"It is difficult to envision a quick turnaround of either, even if economic deceleration may have troughed.\"\n\"As similar policies in other countries have shown, tax cuts are unlikely to translate into higher consumer and business spending when risk aversion is high,\" Moody's said.\n\nThe rating agency said it expects additional easing by the Reserve Bank.\nHowever, if the recent rise in CPI inflation, mainly as a result of higher food prices, is seen to have second-round effects, this would make it more challenging for the central bank to cut interest rates further, it added.\nThe RBI has lowered the repo rate by a cumulative 135 bps in 2019.\nInflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to a 68-month-high of 7.59 per cent in January.\nRBI's mandated target range for retail inflation is 2-6 per cent and the central bank aims to keep it at 4 per cent over the medium term.\nMoody's said that resumption of credit growth is equally important as reviving demand, and banks have been reluctant to lend or lower lending rates despite successive rate cuts by the RBI.\n\"...credit impulse in the economy has deteriorated throughout the last year as a result of the drying up of lending from non-bank financial institutions as well as from banks,\" Moody's said.\nIt said the deterioration in credit growth to the commercial sector is particularly \u201cstark\u201d.\nNominal credit to industry grew at only 1.6 per cent year-on-year in December 2019, while credit to the services sector registered 6.2 per cent\u00a0nominal growth, and credit to agriculture and related activities grew 5.3 per cent, it added.\nWith regard to global growth, Moody's said coronavirus outbreak has diminished optimism about prospects of an incipient stabilisation of global growth this year.\nGlobal\u00a0GDP growth forecast has been revised down, and Moody's now expects G-20 economies to collectively grow 2.4 per cent in 2020, a softer rate than last year, followed by a pick up to 2.8 per cent \u00a0in 2021.\n\"We have reduced our growth forecast for China to 5.2 per cent in 2020 and maintain our expectation of 5.7 per cent growth in 2021,\" it added.\nMoody's expects that the\u00a0spread of coronavirus will be contained by the end of March, and normal economic activity would resume in April-June quarter.\n\"At present, China's economy is by far the worst affected. However, the rest of the world also has exposure as a result of a hit to global tourism in the first half of this year and short-term disruptions to supply chains,\" it said.\n\"The effects on the global economy could compound if the rate of infection does not abate and the death toll continues to rise, because supply chain disruptions in manufacturing would become more acute the longer it takes to restore normalcy,\" Moody's added.\nThe death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic rose to over 1,660, with over 68,500 confirmed cases.\nThe coronavirus outbreak originated in central China's Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries.\nMany countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have suspended flights to the country.

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The Trump administration cut staff by more than two-thirds at a key United States public health agency operating inside China, as part of a larger rollback of US-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has learnt. \n Most of the reductions were made at the Beijing office of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and occurred over the past two years, according to public CDC documents viewed by Reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown. \n The Atlanta-based CDC, America's pre-eminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. It has worked in China for 30 years. \n The CDC's China headcount has shrunk to around 14 staff members, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, the documents show. The four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals. \n The material reviewed by Reuters shows a breakdown of how many American and local Chinese employees were assigned there. \n The documents are the CDC's own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. Reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people. \n \"The CDC office in Beijing is a shell of its former self,\" said one of the people, a US official who worked in China at the time of the drawdown. \n Separately, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the global relief programme which had a role in helping China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their Beijing offices on Mr Trump's watch. Before the closures, each office was staffed by a US official. In addition, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) transferred\u00a0the manager of an animal disease monitoring programme out of China in 2018. \n Reductions at the US agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help China mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the US government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. The Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping US experts from entering the country to assist. \n \"We had a large operation of experts in China who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,\" said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of US personnel. \"You have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.\" \n The White House declined to comment or respond to questions from Reuters regarding the US withdrawal of staff in China. \n The CDC did not respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters about the cuts. It has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the US response to the coronavirus. \n \"There are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,\" the CDC said in a statement. \n Some health experts were sceptical that more CDC employees operating inside China would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak.

Study of positive coronavirus cases in two of the worst affected countries, China and Italy points to somewhat selective pattern of the spread of Covid-19. That the novel coronavirus targets the older people and avoids the young ones. \nSituation gets complicated leading to deaths if the elderly patient already has some medical issues such as breathing problems, diabetes, heart-related ailments and kidney problems. \nThe mean age of those succumbing to novel coronavirus in Italy was reported to be 81 last week. Italy is known as the country with old population; more than 60 per cent of its total population is over 40. This is said to have contributed to more infections and deaths in Italy than places such as South Korea or even Japan.\nChina too is considered a country of aging peopulation. This refers to share of elderly people (above 60) crossing 10 per cent in the total population. China's elderly (above 60) are more than 17 per cent in its total population. Incidentally in China, the Centre for Disease Control reached a similar conclusion as Italy after examining over 72,000 cases that the disease is deadlier in older people. This is also the conclusion of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn India, all the three deaths due to novel coronavirus infection have happened in the cases of elderly patients. The youngest of them was 64. All had previous medical conditions.\nTwo main reasons have been attributed to this age specific coronavirus spread pattern. First, it is a medical fact that immunity is strongest in childhood and decreases with advancement in age. DNA, the genetic material that guides most functions of human body, is agile in childhood and responds quicker to alien particles entering the body. This boosts immunity. With advancement of age, the DNA messaging gets corrupted and the right message to disease fighting cells are not delivered efficiently.\nSecondly, in most countries, coronavirus testing are symptomatic in process. That is, only those showing synonyms are being tested for novel coronavirus infection. This means a number of children may be passing off without being tested for novel coronavirus. \nWith stronger immunity, children may not show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection even if they have contracted the contagion. Untested children means more adults entering the records and hence further skew in the final data.\nThis does not mean that children are completely immune to novel coronavirus infection. At two cases -- one each from China and the UK -- were reported about newborns having tested positive for novel coronavirus. Though, the disease Covid-19 has not been found to be transferring from mother to child during pregnancy. A three-year-old child tested positive for Covid-19 in India. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in India.\nBut the fact that children are largely untested underscores that they can be carriers or vectors of novel coronavirus. Also, medical conditions like asthma and diabetes are not uncommon among children. In many cases obesity-linked diabetes and asthma are related. In such cases, novel coronavirus infection can be fatal for children. "}, {"content": "Coronavirus in India: 44 infected so far, virus reaches Punjab, Karnataka and J&K | 10 developments.

As with the other four German cases, it is an employee of the automotive supplier Webasto, which was established in the Upper Bavarian Starnberg, as the Bavarian Ministry of Health.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example.\nIn China, several thousand persons have been ill Some of them - most probably with pre-conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help.\nMeanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThat can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS.\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) stressed that Germany was well prepared for the virus. In an interview with the magazine Focus he said, the Federal Government had taken measures to identify suspected cases early and thus minimize the risk of contagion. Spahn said he did not hold the novel respiratory disease for an emergency in Germany: \"We are very alert. But left.\"\nIn China, infections and deaths continued to increase by coronavirus. The number of patients grew by 1,981 to now 9,692, as the health commission reported in Beijing. The number of dead rose by 42 to 213. The World Health Organization (WHO) had previously explained the spread of the virus to a \"health requirement of international scope\". The 190 member countries will thus coordinate crisis measures recommended by the WHO.\nBecause of the virus, the US State Department issued a travel warning for the whole of China. The Foreign Office in Berlin was initially warned before traveling in the most affected province Hubei, but recommended in a subscript warning, not necessary trips to China \"if possible\".

(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* GRAPHIC: ICE Newcastle coal vs. SGX Indonesia coal: reut.rs/3bmYOzG\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, March 26 (Reuters) - Asia\u2019s seaborne coal market is increasingly diverging between higher-quality Australian coal, where prices are holding up despite the economic shock being caused by the coronavirus, and lower-quality Indonesian fuel, which is losing ground.\nThe price of Australian benchmark Newcastle thermal coal futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange ended at $66.35 a tonne on Wednesday, down slightly from the prior day but up from the low so far this year of $65.15 on March 9.\nThe contract, which covers coal with an energy value of 6,000 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg), has traded in a fairly narrow band so far this year, and at the close on Wednesday was only 2% weaker than at the end of last year.\nThis is despite the massive disruption caused to the economy of China, the world\u2019s biggest coal importer, in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus from its origin in the city of Wuhan.\nWhile China has largely contained the virus, it has now spread across the globe, leading to increasingly strong isolation measures in many countries, with the concomitant economic fallout.\nHowever, futures for Indonesian coal with an energy rating of 4,200 kcal/kg traded in Singapore ended at $32.61 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest price this year.\nThe contract is down 10.7% from its peak so far in 2020 of $36.51 a tonne on Feb. 10, and is also 4% softer than its close at the end of last year.\nWhat lies behind the divergence of the two main types of seaborne coal in Asia?\nThe most likely explanation is the current coronavirus crisis is changing market dynamics, rather than any structural change in supply or demand.\nIndonesia\u2019s coal exports have been in a range around 30 million tonnes in recent months, with China and India accounting for about 60% of the total.\nAt the start of the year, both markets were performing well, with China actually importing more coal during its coronavirus lockdown, due to the impact on domestic mines and transport infrastructure.\nIndia\u2019s imports from Indonesia were also resilient in the first two months of the year as coastal power plants increased generation, but they appear to be tapering off this month.\nIn the first 25 days of March just 4.04 million tonnes of Indonesian coal was discharged at Indian ports, according to vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv.\nWhile that figure will rise by the end of month as more cargoes are unloaded, it looks certain that March\u2019s total will be below February\u2019s 7.96 million tonnes and January\u2019s 7.42 million.\nIndia has lagged the rest of Asia in being hit by the coronavirus, but the country is now taking strong lockdown measures to prevent its spread, which will curb demand for electricity to power industry.\nCoal stocks at power plants and mines have also been rising, with the Business Standard newspaper reporting on March 24 that inventories were above 100 million tonnes, with stocks at plants reaching a record 41.4 million tonnes.\nPlentiful stocks combined with a sharp slowdown in economic activity mean India\u2019s coal imports are likely to slip in coming months, especially from Indonesia.\nAustralia supplies virtually no thermal coal to India, which generally takes Indonesian coal because of its lower cost and cheaper freight rates. Australia\u2019s trade with India is largely in coking coal used in steel-making.\nThe main markets for Australian thermal coal are China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and Refinitiv data shows these markets have been resilient so far this year.\nTogether these four markets imported 26.8 million tonnes of both thermal and coking coal from Australia in January, the most since July last year, while February\u2019s total was 21.22 million, up from 20.1 million in the same month last year.\nWith the coronavirus outbreak seemingly contained in China and Taiwan, and progress being made in Japan and South Korea, it\u2019s possible that their imports of coal will hold up in coming months, with the main risk being the economic downturn in the rest of the world.\nAssuming no shock to supply should mines be forced to close in Australia to combat the coronavirus, there is a case that prices shouldn\u2019t decline too much, but it would be difficult to make a bullish case until the world economy is showing signs of recovery.\nWith far greater exposure to India, Indonesian coal prices are more under threat, and will remain so until it\u2019s clear that the world\u2019s second-biggest importer of coal has beaten the coronavirus.

BEIJING:\u00a0A new virus that has killed nine people, infected hundreds and reached the United States could mutate and spread, China warned on Wednesday (Jan 22), as authorities urged people to steer clear of the city at the heart of the outbreak. \n The coronavirus has caused alarm due to its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n With hundreds of millions of people travelling across China this week for the Chinese New Year holiday, the National Health Commission announced measures to contain the disease -\u00a0including sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains. \n  \n In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, authorities cancelled large public events, called on visitors to stay away and urged residents not to leave the central Chinese city of 11 million people. \n The illness is mainly transmitted via the respiratory tract and there \"is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease\", health commission vice minister Li Bin told a news conference in Beijing. \n The virus has now infected at least 440 people across the country, with most cases in Wuhan. Li added that 1,394 people are still under medical observation. \n The World Health Organization (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has now been detected in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Macau. \n The first case in the United States - a Seattle resident in his 30s - is in good condition, American officials said. \n The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures. \n  \n But they still have not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus, which has infected at least 440 people across the country. \n \"We will step up research efforts to identify the source and transmission of the disease,\" Li said, although he said experts believe \"the cases are mostly linked to Wuhan\". \n  \n Countries have been intensifying efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen - known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) -\u00a0as the number of cases jumped. \n Plane passengers are facing screening measures at five US airports and a host of transport hubs across Asia. \n North Korea will ban foreign tourists entirely to protect itself against the virus, according to a major tour operator. \n VIRUS SOURCE \n A prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people. \n  \n However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak. \n A price list circulating online in China for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes , crocodiles, wolf puppies and rats. It also offered civets, the animal linked to SARS. \n \"We already know that the disease originated from a market which conducted illegal transaction of wild animals,\" said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention. \n He said it was clear \"this virus is adapting and mutating\". \n Hong Kong and British scientists have estimated that between 1,300 and 1,700 people in Wuhan may have been infected. \n CONTAINMENT \n Health authorities are urging people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air, and wear a mask if they have a cough. \n Anyone with a cough or fever was urged to go to hospital. \n Surgical masks and antibacterial products were starting to sell out on some popular online sites and pharmacies. \n  \n \"These days, I wear masks even in places that are not too crowded, although I wouldn't have done so in the past,\" said Wang Suping, 50, who works at a Beijing arts school. \n At the capital's main international airport, the majority of people were wearing masks. \n Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Airlines said they agreed to allow staff to wear surgical masks on mainland China flights, adding they would offer masks and antiseptic wipes to passengers travelling from Wuhan to the city. \n In Wuhan, police were conducting vehicle spot checks for live poultry or wild animals leaving and entering the city, state media said. Officials also screened people on roads, the airport and the train station for fevers. \n \"If it's not necessary we suggest that people don't come to Wuhan,\" Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV. \n The local government has cancelled major public activities and banned tour groups from heading out of the city. \n Women's football qualifiers for the Tokyo Olympic Games that were supposed to be held in Wuhan between Feb\u00a03-9 were moved to the eastern city of Nanjing. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram "}, {"content": "There are fears - and there is racism.

HONG KONG \u2014 When a virus enters the human body, it's in a race against time to hijack cells, reproduce and spread. Its survival depends on it, because once the body's immune system detects the intruder an all-out microscopic war follows. \n While the Sars-CoV-2 virus behind the present pandemic has killed thousands and spread fear around the world, the immune system \u2014 which has evolved over millions of years of fighting pathogens\u00a0\u2014 shows no such trepidation. It responds with ferocity to obliterate the invader, led by armies of killer T-cells. \n That immune system is one reason the human species still exists, but in some cases its fight against viruses can resemble the scorched-earth policy of warfare, where everything in the area of the conflict takes damage, meaning body tissue itself. The immune system takes no prisoners. \n But before the war at the cellular level, the virus slips into the body, navigating past defences in the mucus that gathers in noses and throats, on the hunt for cells it can commandeer. At the same time, it's trying to disguise its presence to avoid tripping the chemical alarm system of the immune system\u00a0\u2014 a deadly game of hide-and-seek. \n In the first few hours after the pathogen's entry, it was \"almost like a dance between the innate immune response and the virus\", said Mr Gene Olinger, an immunologist with the US-based scientific institute MRIGlobal. The virus tries different tricks to dodge the immune system's many detection devices. \n This was the start of what become an \"arms race\" between the virus and immune system, said Ms Marjolein Kikkert, an associate professor who researches this type of biochemical conflict at Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. \n \"All viruses, including this one, will have multiple ways that they look to circumvent or suppress immune response ... there's an arms race, especially in the beginning, when the virus is trying to prevent these first responses,\" Ms Kikkert said. \n Once the immune system is triggered and a T-cell finds a body cell that has become a virus factory, it typically latches on and fires molecules that punch through the cell's membrane, killing it and everything inside. \n But as Sars-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus, researchers have not had enough laboratory time to determine the specifics of how the battle plays out. That leaves questions like why some healthy people infected with Sars-CoV-2 become severely ill and others do not, researchers have said. \n Much of what is suspected about how the body fights back is based on research on the body's immune response to closely related coronavirus infections, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). There are also the clinical records of patients with Covid-19, the disease caused by Sars-CoV-2. \n What that indicates is that \"every part of the immune system is needed to clear this virus\", according to Mr Stanley Perlman Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Brent oil falls 2% with fears of a search retreat.

The Bavarian health authorities confirmed the four first cases in the Federal Republic on Tuesday.\nFirst, the new lung disease had been demonstrated from the district of Landsberg am Lech at a 33-year-old man. He had infected himself in his company in a suburb of Munich at a colleague from China. On Tuesday evening, the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced that three more people have infected with the novel coronavirus. \"These patients are also staff of the company from the district of Starnberg,\" it continued.\nThe four those affected were stored in the Munich clinic Schwabing stationary and medically monitored and isolated, as the Ministry announced. \"For some other contact persons, there is currently a test whether there is an infection with the coronavirus here too.\" Bavaria's Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) said: \"A total of around 40 employees of the company were determined, which come into question as close contact persons. The affected persons should be tested on Wednesday as a precaution. \"Then the ministry also wants to inform the current state of affairs by press release.\nThe 33-year-old had infected himself according to the Bavarian Provincial Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL) at a colleague from China, which had come to a training to the car supplier Webasto in the Gautinger district Stockdorf in the Upper Bavarian district of Starnberg in the past week. The woman had noticed her infection on 23 January on the return flight to China.\nThe novel coronavirus 2019-NCOV can trigger a lung disease, which has already died more than 100 people in the main distribution country China - most of them were older patients with severe pre-existing conditions. The total number of globally known diseases has now risen to more than 4500, in China, at least 106 people died of lung disease.\nThe first coronavirus patient had been positively tested on the virus on Monday - since he had gone to work again. \"He's pretty good, yesterday morning he was still working,\" said LGL President Andreas Zapf. \"He's fever-free, has no respiratory symptoms anymore,\" added to the treating chief physician Clemens Wendtner from the Klinikum Schwabing. The man is in an insulating room, for other patients there is no danger.\nThe people who had contacted Chinese and the first-diseased German Webasto staff are under observation according to LGL information and are invited not to leave their home. The 33-year-old patient is family father, his child goes according to the Ministry of Health in a crib in the district of Landsberg am Lech. Even these are now under observation, said LGL President Zapf. Nothing was known about the marital status of the three other patients. The Head of Task Force Infectiology , Martin high, stressed: \"The number can still rise.\"\nThe new 2019-NCOV virus is originally probably from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it was probably overwhelmed by wild animals on humans. According to the current assessment of experts, the novel lung disease apparently runs in most cases mild, possibly even without symptoms.\nTransfers before the first symptoms are considered very rare. Thus, the first confirmed Coronavirus case in Germany possibly also provides new insights on the contagion paths of lung disease. For the man had infected himself after first findings at the Chinesein, although she did not show any symptoms of the disease at the time.\nThe authorities now want to initiate further action in Bavaria. An official hotline of the Bavarian authorities was switched, some health insurance companies did that too.

Further escalation stages of the alarm plan are possible: Currently, together with the federal government, \"whether it can be useful to measure fever at airports,\" said Minister Huml. The world's largest playwear fair in Nuremberg is expecting less visitors from China in view of the Coronavirus outbreak this year.\nThere is no reason to panic, I did not emphasize Huml - as well as her office colleague, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU).

There are already nine fatal victims and the number of infected continues to grow with every hour of day: the latest data speak of 440 patients. To put in perspective: Friday were only 41, and the Municipal Health Commission ensured that medical tests did not throw positive results since January 3. The climbing of this new coronavirus, discovered two weeks ago, recalls that of SARS, with which it saves genetic similarities. The epidemic of 2002, also originated in China, caused the death of 700 people around the world.\nMost of the infections (270) is concentrated in Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak emerged in December. From this city, located in the central area of \u200b\u200bthe Chinese territory and home of 11 million people -more London or New York-, the pathogen has begun to extend to the neighboring provinces. If last Friday there was no positive out there, today there are 38 cases distributed by another 15 large cities.\nBut these data may not be entirely reliable. A model developed by experts from the Epidemiology Center for Infectious Diseases from Hong Kong University suggests that reality is even more worrisome than the official figures reveal. According to its report, prepared in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and presented on Tuesday, the total number of infected could already rub at 1,500: 1,343 in Wuhan and 115 in the rest of the country.\nSkepticism is logical, inicing of a country in which freedom of information does not prevail. Many also remember the precedent of SARS, when the authorities denied the existence of the virus for weeks. The Chinese Communist Party has referred to that same episode to warn local and regional administrations that they must accurately report on the course of the facts. \"Everyone who does not say the truth will be nailed to the pillar of shame for all eternity,\" Chan An Jian proclaimed Monday, official profile of the Central Commission of Political and Legal Affairs, Supervisor Arm of the Party on Legal Party . This sentence adds to yesterday's intervention of the Secretary General Xi Jinping, in which he called \"take away\" the containment of the outbreak.\nThere is another reason for uneasiness: the estimates of the model of the University of Hong Kong respond to a \"moderate scenario\", in which Wuhan remains as the only focus of the outbreak and do not appear highly contagious, known as \"superproopagers\". This last risk factor, however, could already be a reality.\nWHO performed a visit to Wuhan next to a group of Chinese health experts, led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, director of the State Laboratory for Infectious Diseases in Canton and National Eminence. Their findings show that 15 medical employees in the city would have contracted the virus, which confirms the possibility of contagion between humans - an extreme discarded until this weekend. 14 of them, in addition, would have been infected by a single patient, as Nanshan revealed yesterday in an interview with national television, which opens the door to the existence of these \"superprophatemen\". \"The key to controlling expansion at this time goes by preventing its appearance,\" said the researcher.\nMeanwhile, international expansion continues. To the four cases located to date in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the first positive in Taiwan has been added on Tuesday. It is a woman of 55 years who, as in the previous cases, also visited Wuhan in recent weeks. \"The patient developed the symptoms as of January 11, but she did not enter a hospital,\" Huang Wang-Ting, doctor of Taiwan Epidemias Central Command, reported. The Minister of Health of the Island, Chen Shih-Chung, has ensured that none of the relatives of the sick presents any symptom, similar to those of ordinary pneumonia, and that another 46 people who were in contact with her during the journey of Airplane have been put into observation. Likewise, the Philippines and Australia have also announced having taken measures before the first suspected cases in their national territory.\nThe WHO has communicated that an emergency meeting will be held tomorrow, an emergency meeting to decide whether it declares \"an international public health emergency\" because of the outbreak. The Chinese State Council, for its part, has also scheduled a press conference in which it will detail the evolution of the virus in the last hours.

That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.\nChinese authorities say the stabilization in the number of new cases is a sign that measures they have taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.\nHowever, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared.\nChina has responded to the COVID-19 virus by effectively locking down Hubei\u2019s provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people.\nThe Communist Party is also struggling to prevent the economy from crashing, as the movement of people and goods around the country and to and from China faces major disruption.\nOn Monday China\u2019s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending, a move that is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.\nEven so, economists expect China\u2019s economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.\nOutside China, around half of all known cases of the virus have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, where around 400 people have tested positive since the cruise liner was ordered to stay under quarantine off Japan on Feb. 3.\nThe United States was the first country to evacuate its passengers from the ship, flying them out overnight on two chartered aircraft to military bases in Texas and California, where they would be held in quarantine for two weeks.\nThe state department said that after passengers were sent to the airport, officials discovered 14 had tested positive. They were isolated on the flight and permitted to fly home, it said.\nOther countries were expected to follow swiftly, having announced plans to repatriate citizens from the ship. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.\nAuthorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.\nOne American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.\nCarnival Corp. , which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.\n\u201cGuests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,\u201d a statement from the company\u2019s Holland America Line unit said. Hundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.\n\u201cWe will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health,\u201d said passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. \u201cWe have no idea when we get to get home.\u201d\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.\nSome cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.\nIn Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.\nTrade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recession is possible. It is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow on Tuesday.\nOrganizers of the Tokyo Marathon have decided to limit the March 1 race to top-level athletes, banning 38,000 general participants, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.\nJapan\u2019s Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito\u2019s public birthday address on Feb. 23, his first since his coronation last year.

But do you know the number of times a doctor has to wash hands after treating patients infected with the Covid-19 disease, which is caused by the virus?\nA video shared on Twitter by China Global Television Network will answer this question. To begin with, doctors, who treat coronavirus patients, wear protective suits and multiple gloves. In the video, a doctor washes her hands firstly and then, takes off her shoe covers. She washes her hands again and takes off the first layer of gloves, and then, does the most obvious. Wash her hands.\nAfter unzipping her medical gown, she again, washes her hands. She, soon after, takes off the hat of her medical gown and rigorously washes her hands. Well, in this manner, she washes her hands after every step of taking off her medical suit.

BEIJING (AFP) - As the rest of the world is engulfed in the coronavirus pandemic, China says it has turned the tide against the disease that has killed thousands of people. \n From initial attempts to cover up the outbreak to later locking down cities and now declaring it \"basically curbed\", here is a look at how China grappled with Covid-19: \n The first case emerged in the central city of Wuhan on Dec 8 before several workers at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market began to fall sick with\u00a0fever. \n On Dec 31, Wuhan health authorities announced 27 cases of suspected viral pneumonia linked to the market and notified the World Health Organisation. \n But officials insisted there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that it was \"preventable and controllable\". \n A day later, eight people were reprimanded by Wuhan police for \"spreading rumours\" about the then mysterious disease. \n There had been social media talk of a re-emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), another coronavirus\u00a0which killed nearly 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Dr Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was among those punished for raising the alarm. \n The number of cases in Wuhan jumped to 44 on Jan 3 and health authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore issued travel alerts. \n China announced the existence of a \"new type of coronavirus\" on Jan 9 and the first death two days later. \n But between Jan 5 and Jan 17, China reported no new cases of the virus, while Japan and Thailand declared their first infections. \n During this time, Wuhan and Hubei province pressed ahead with their annual legislative meetings despite the outbreak. \n Meanwhile, doctors were ordered to keep quiet about the virus and evidence of human transmission they had seen, according to an interview with Dr Ai Fen, one of the earliest medical whistle-blowers on the outbreak and a colleague of Dr Li. \n An annual mass banquet for 40,000 families organised by Wuhan authorities went ahead on Jan 18. \n The same day, Beijing sent a team of scientific experts to Wuhan to investigate. \n On Jan 20, President Xi Jinping ordered that the virus be \"resolutely contained\", in his first public comment on the issue. \n Human-to-human transmission was finally confirmed by a leading Chinese expert that day. \n This marked a major turning point in the epidemic, with 291 infections reported nationwide. \n Panic took hold in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, when it was abruptly placed on lockdown on Jan 23. The rest of Hubei province was sealed off in the following days. \n Wuhan hospitals, inundated with patients, reported dire shortages of medical supplies. Many who could not get timely treatment for themselves or relatives relayed personal tragedies on social media. \n The virus spread as hundreds of millions of people travelled across the country and abroad for the Chinese New Year holiday\u00a0before travel curbs were imposed. \n On Jan 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a \"global emergency\". \n Between Feb 1 and Feb 7, cases in China ballooned from 11,791 to 31,161, while deaths reached 636. \n On Feb 7 the Wuhan medical whistle-blower Dr Li died from the coronavirus, triggering a wave of public grief and anger. \n Many grievances against the authorities were swiftly censored on social media. \n Days later, four high-profile local officials were purged and replaced to appease public disquiet - including the Communist Party secretaries of Wuhan and Hubei. \n The province recorded a huge jump of 14,840 new infections on Feb 13 due to a change in diagnostic criteria, raising questions about the credibility of China's data. \n Mr Xi, usually a ubiquitous presence on state media, remained out of the spotlight. \n But on Feb 15, Beijing released a speech by Mr Xi showing he had urged officials to contain the outbreak as early as Jan 7 - well before the authorities announced human-to-human transmission - in an attempt to boost the leader's public image. \n In late February and early March, the number of new cases in Hubei and other parts of China steadily declined as outbreaks flared up in Italy, Iran and South Korea. \n On Tuesday (March 10), Mr Xi visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began, suggesting the Communist Party was confident it had the situation under control. \n Wuhan officials touted the sealing off of all residential estates from Feb 11 as \"critical\" in curbing the spread in the city, although some experts believe it led to more cross-infections within households. \n After more than 4,600 deaths and 126,000 infections across the country, China is now trying to reshape the global narrative in response to overseas criticism, casting itself as a leader in the heroic fight against the virus while other countries struggle to cope.

BEIJING: Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday (Jan 27) for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters. \n Yang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected more than 4,000 people and killed at least 106 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease. \n Yang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time. \n \"My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don't get any new answers,\" Zhang told Reuters. \"Every time the responses are the same: 'There's no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what's going on.' The doctors are all very frustrated too.\" \n Officially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan\u00a010, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travellers from China for the virus within three days. \n However, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan's hospitals until about Jan\u00a020, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. \n Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities. \n During that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China. \n Despite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. \n In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \"rumour spreaders\". \n \"The doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves ... no one told us anything,\" a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. \n Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan\u00a020, five days after she was hospitalised. \"I posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.\" \n National, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled.\u00a0National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \"loopholes\" in initial treatment methods. \n Wuhan's mayor Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters"}, {"content": "u.s. ramps up anti-coronavirus measures at border as impact spreads. SHANGHAI/WASHINGTON - The United States ramped up its response to the coronavirus epidemic on Friday, declaring a public health emergency and saying it would halt entry to foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period.  \n That measure followed on from an earlier travel advisory that warned Americans not to travel to China and angered Beijing.  \n Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like virus first identified earlier in January has resulted in 213 deaths in China, according to local health authorities. Wuhan and the surrounding region of Hubei are in virtual quarantine.  \n More than 9,800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.  \n The World Health Organization said on Thursday that the epidemic constituted a public health emergency of international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination.  \n \"Following the World Health Organization's decision... I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,\" U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a public briefing on Friday afternoon.  \n As of Sunday, U.S. citizens who had been in Hubei would be subject to compulsory quarantine, he said. Foreign nationals - aside from the immediate family of citizens and residents - who had travelled in China in the last 14 days would be denied entry, said Azar.  \n \"The risk is low in the United States... but our job is to keep that risk low as much as we can,\" he said.  \n The move will likely anger Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with Washington. Earlier on Friday, it criticized the U.S. travel warning.  \n \"The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \"It's truly mean.\"  \n Other countries have also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China or restricted flights. After reporting its first two cases of the illness, Russia on Friday restricted direct flights to China, its biggest trade partner.  \n Singapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders.  \n Many airlines have chosen to cancel or reduce flights, with airline crews pressuring carriers to act.  \n Governments around the world are evacuating citizens from Hubei. A plane with 83 British and 27 foreign nationals landed in Britain on Friday, while Japan, with 14 confirmed cases, has sent three flights to bring citizens home.  \n The United States said it would channel all flights from China through seven airports. It has put 195 Americans evacuated to California this week in quarantine.  \n The virus has an incubation of between one and 14 days , and there are some limited signs it may also be able to spread before any symptoms show.  \n  \n GLOBAL REVERBERATIONS  \n With major fallout inevitable for China's economy, which is the world's second largest, global shares posted their biggest weekly and monthly losses since August on Friday. [MKTS/GLOB]  \n The outbreak could \"reverberate globally,\" Moody's said.  \n In the latest impact to big name corporations, South Korea's Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend due to a supply disruption caused by the outbreak.  \n Home appliance maker Electrolux <ELUXb.ST> issued a similar warning, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen <PEUP.PA> said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid-February, and tractor maker Deere & Co <DE.N> said it was temporarily shutting its facilities in China.  \n WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the WHO did not support travel or trade curbs. Tedros reiterated in a series of tweets on Friday that his organization had confidence in China's capacity to control the 2019-nCoV virus.  \n \"Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies. We urge countries and companies to make evidence-based, consistent decisions.\"  \n  \n VIRUS EPICENTRE  \n The roughly 60 million residents of Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, have had movements curbed to try and slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, a Reuters witness said, and infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan.  \n China's statistics show just over 2% of infected people have died, suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002-2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  \n But economists say its financial impact could be bigger than SARS, which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of $33 billion to the global economy, since China's share of the world economy is now far greater.  \n Like other respiratory infections, the coronavirus spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. No deaths have been reported outside China, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be.  \n \"The issue now with this is that there's a lot of unknowns,\" said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Robert Redfield.  \n The WHO has reported at least eight cases of human-to-human transmission - as opposed to people coming infected from China - in four countries: the United States, Germany, Japan and Vietnam. Thailand said it too had such a case.  \n Graphic - Tracking China\u2019s novel coronavirus: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html  \n Graphic - The Coronavirus Outbreak: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH/0100B59Y39P/index.html REUTERS "}, {"content": "Scientists identify two types of Covid-19 virus.

The remarks by Mr Du Bin, chairman of the critical care medical branch of the Chinese Medical Association, are the most conclusive assessment of the virus' incubation period by a government-affiliated medical body. \n The revelations came amid a fall in new cases following crippling restrictions imposed on the world's second-largest economy to stop its spread. \n China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of last month. \n The total number of cases on the mainland has now reached 80,270.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The emergence of a new virus in central China has brought back painful memories of another virulent respiratory disease that wreaked worldwide havoc and left the country\u2019s health authorities struggling to rebuild public trust.\nBut global health experts said China has come a long way since 2003, when it was accused of trying to cover up a major outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a previously unknown virus believed to have emerged from the wet markets of Guangdong province before spreading into major cities. As many as 774 people died in an epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries.\nNow, nearly 17 years later, government officials insist they have learned from past mistakes as they try to contain the latest deadly viral pneumonia strain, which has infected 440 people, mostly in Wuhan city, and killed nine since it was first identified at the end of last month.\nLiu Heng, an adviser to China\u2019s cabinet said it took the country about four or five months to announce the SARS outbreak to the public, and this time it had taken less than a month.\n\u201cWe are doing much better now... We are paying greater attention to preventing the epidemic,\u201d he told reporters.\nLi Bin, vice minister at the National Health Commission, told reporters on Wednesday that since 2003, China had established comprehensive new procedures to handle major health threats.\n\u201cWith relatively complete prevention and control systems for sudden and infectious diseases in place since SARS ... and with the support of the broad masses of the public, we are confident of victory,\u201d he said.\nA key factor watched by experts both at home and overseas has been the rapid disclosure of information about the genetic structure of the virus and the way it has spread through the population.\nLi said Beijing had learned from its experiences with SARS and was now sharing all relevant data with international stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\u201cThe speed with which this virus has been identified is testament to changes in public health in China since SARS and strong global coordination through the WHO,\u201d said Jeremy Farrar, a British infectious diseases specialist who also worked on combating SARS.\nExperts say the failures of SARS were caused by an under-resourced and overcentralised health system with little experience of infectious diseases and no information disclosure mechanisms. Local governments were also reluctant to take responsibility for the rapid spread of infections.\nBeijing has since established the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention that hooks up hospitals and clinics nationwide and reports outbreaks in real time. It has also set up specific mechanisms for new pneumonia strains.\n\u201cChina... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since SARS, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections , so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,\u201d said Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at the Kirby Institute in Sydney.\nVice-minister Li said China\u2019s health infrastructure was also now better able to cope, with the country ready to deploy several \u201cback-up\u201d hospitals that could be put into action should the number of infected people spike further.\nThe silence on the part of authorities during the early stages of SARS helped create a rumor mill that sparked panic in several major cities and brought the economy to a standstill. One estimate suggested China\u2019s economy slowed by around 1-2 percentage points in 2003 as a result of SARS.\nThis time, officials have been warned they face public ignominy if they cover up any infections, and the message throughout state media has been about the need for greater transparency. Communist Party-backed tabloid Global Times said on Wednesday that \u201cconcealment would be a serious blow to the government\u2019s credibility and might trigger greater social panic\u201d.\nPresident Xi Jinping has vowed to curb the spread of the virus, which has erupted just before the nation begins its biggest holiday this week, the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions people travel.\nNevertheless, some people said Chinese officials are cracking down on those who spread news about the disease online.\nSocial media is still awash with cover-up claims, and some doubts are still being expressed about the accuracy and timeliness of China\u2019s data.\n\u201cWe can only judge the information we are being provided and have no way to determine if any information is not being disclosed,\u201d said MacIntyre.\nAnd the big test of lessons learned could be still to come, when new year travel could create countless new vectors for the potential transmission of the virus.\nAdam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said China has \u201ccome a long way\u201d since the outbreak of SARS.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we could expect more of them at this stage in the outbreak, particularly when they are understandably focused on responding to the outbreak and trying to contain it ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations,\u201d he said.

The report was called \u201cinsulting\u201d by Indonesian Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto earlier this week. \n Harvard Professor Marc Lipsitch said in response to the criticism that the academics had meant to be \u201chelpful\u201d and had conducted the study to see if the total number of detected cases was representative of the actual incidence of Covid-19. \n In the latest study, the researchers, including Prof Lipsitch who was involved in both studies, said their model is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n The researchers said their model in the latest study is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n High surveillance countries, such as Thailand, Australia and South Korea, came in at 40 per cent of the city-state\u2019s ability to detect imported cases, the study concluded. Low surveillance ones, such as several African and Middle Eastern nations, achieve just 11 per cent of Singapore\u2019s capacity. \n \u201cPut another way, this implies that the true number of cases in travellers is at least 2.8 times the number that has been detected,\u201d the study said. \n However, Singapore\u2019s detection is \u201cprobably not 100 per cent efficient\u201d, and the model was also able to estimate that there are around 1.8 undetected cases for every detected Covid-19 patient in the city-state. \n It noted the number of Singapore cases that have no known links to China or any recent travel history. \u201cSingapore\u2019s detection like that in other countries has relied largely on symptoms and travel history, so the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases missed by such a strategy is unknown,\u201d the authors said. \n What the study implies is that the true number of Covid-19 cases could be higher than previously thought, they added. \n The model proves that the number of undetected cases of coronavirus is correlated to air travel connectivity and is inverse to a country\u2019s detection capacity \u2014 and that the risks of the virus going undetected could happen anywhere around the world. \n \u201c(This could lead) to the potential risk of self-sustained transmission, which may be an early stage of a global pandemic,\u201d the study said.

Proof is that we find suspicious cases, we validate and refer to the right hospitals. The three other situations, as they know, arrived quickly and exemptedly at their hospital.

SINGAPORE: A new strain of coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China and overseas, killing more than 20 people since it was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier this month. \n Here is what we know about the outbreak so far: \n IT IS SIMILAR, BUT SO FAR MILDER THAN SARS \n The pathogen appears to be a new strain of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause diseases such as the common cold and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003. \n It has been named \"2019-nCoV\". \n Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told AFP that the new strain was 80 per cent genetically identical to SARS. \n The symptoms caused by the new virus appears to be less aggressive as compared to SARS, according to an AFP report. These include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. \n However, its milder nature can also cause alarm as it allows more people to travel further before symptoms can be detected, the director of the Institute of Global Health Antoine Flahault said. \n SUSPECTED TO HAVE ORIGINATED FROM ANIMALS, STARTED AT A SEAFOOD MARKET IN WUHAN \n The virus was first detected at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been shut down by authorities following the outbreak. \n  \n The market offered exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game, AFP reported. \n Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n Two studies from China indicated that bats are the likely origin, as the strain was found to be closely related to a strain that exists in the animal. \n \"Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,\" the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in a paper. \n Another study identified snakes as a possible intermediate host. \n HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION, NOT AIRBORNE BUT SPREAD THROUGH WATER DROPLETS \n Animals have been determined as the source of the virus, but human-to-human transmission of the virus is \"affirmative\", top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan told state broadcaster CCTV. \n It has since been passed to people who have had no contact with the market where the virus first broke out. \n Doctor Nathalie MacDermott of King's College London told AFP that it seems likely that the virus is spread through droplets in the air from sneezing or coughing. \n There is currently no vaccine for the virus. \n RECOMMENDED PROTECTION \n Members of the public have been advised to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes wearing masks when experiencing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing , and observe good hygiene practices, like washing their hands frequently. \n They should also avoid places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness. \n Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health has issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid contact with live animals and consuming raw and undercooked meat. \n Those who are feeling unwell should also seek prompt medical attention, it added. \n  \n CITIES LOCKED DOWN IN CHINA \n More than 800 people have been infected with the coronavirus in China, with at least 26 fatalities reported. \n  \n Most of the patients came from Wuhan, where the virus started. It has since spread to other major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. \n Transport in and out of Wuhan have ceased operations in an effort to prevent and control the spread of the virus. \n Authorities have also locked down several cities in Hubei province as a response to the outbreak. Entertainment venues such as Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland park, theatres and karaoke bars have also been closed down. \n Hubei province authorities also said they were calling off cultural performances and public cultural venues.

By that time, the outbreak was under control.\nThis time, research groups worldwide are already executing plans to test vaccines, treatments and other countermeasures to stop the newly identified virus from spreading globally.\nMULTI-PRONGED APPROACH\nThey are attacking from several angles, with global health and epidemic response agencies hoping at least one treatment will be in human trials within a few months.\nFauci's agency is partnering with US biotech Moderna Inc, which specializes in vaccines based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) - a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins.\nThat team hopes to make an RNA vaccine based on one of the crown-like spikes on the surface of the coronavirus that gives the family of viruses their name, an approach that, unlike many vaccines, would not expose people to the virus.\nAt the University of Queensland in Australia, scientists backed by the global health emergency group the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said they are working on what they describe as a \"molecular clamp\" vaccine approach.\nThe technology adds a gene to viral proteins to stabilize them and trick the body into thinking it is seeing a live virus and create antibodies against it.\nKeith Chappell, an expert in the University's school of chemistry and molecular biosciences, said the technology is designed as \"a platform approach to generate vaccines against a range of human and animal viruses.\"\nIt has already shown promising results in lab tests on other dangerous viruses such as Ebola and the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)- a cousin of SARS and the Wuhan virus.\nNovavax, which already has a vaccine in development against MERS, says it is now working on one for the Wuhan coronavirus.\nScientists also are turning to infection-fighting proteins known as monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, that were developed against the SARS and MERS coronaviruses.\nThe hope is that similarities with the Wuhan virus will offer enough overlap in the antibodies to help people infected in the China outbreak.\nVir Biotechnology Chief Scientific Officer Herbert Virgin said his company has a library of monoclonal antibodies that have shown some success against SARS and MERS in lab tests.\nSome of these antibodies have been shown to neutralize coronaviruses, Virgin said, and \"may have the potential to treat and prevent (the) Wuhan coronavirus.\" "}, {"content": "WHO promises support to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe in any cases of coronaviruses.

LONDON: Companies and tourists out of pocket from the global disruption caused by the virus epidemic in China risk meeting a cold shoulder from insurers, industry experts warn. \n Basic travel insurance policies are unlikely to cover epidemics. Instead, individuals are being advised initially to consult their credit card or travel providers to get refunded for cancelled bookings, and for medical costs. \n Leading British insurer Aviva said customers need to have specific coverage for \"travel disruption\" as part of their policy to be sure of reimbursement for changes to their plans. \n \"We're monitoring the situation closely, but so far the overwhelming majority of claims relate to customers who are travelling to and from China,\" an Aviva spokeswoman said. \n Allianz of Germany said the first port of call for individuals suffering disruption should be their airline or travel agency, rather than their insurer. \n The company said the outbreak was \"clearly a very urgent alert\" but at this stage, normal terms and conditions of insurance contracts applied. \n CORONAVIRUS A\u00a0\"KNOWN EVENT\" \n The General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA) said that most insurers \"consider the 2019-nCoV a known event\", and have issued consumer advisories on travel insurance claims related to or arising from the event. \n Customers should\u00a0approach their insurers if they are in doubt about whether a claim is covered in their respective policies - this includes\u00a0travel cancellation, flight postponement\u00a0and trip curtailment arising from the coronavirus situation. \n They should also keep themselves updated on insurers' latest consumer advisories, GIA said. \n The eligibility of claims can be affected by a cut-off date for coverage, affected regions visited and reasons for travel disruption, it added. \n For companies such as airlines that are now ripping up their China plans, there may be no recourse from their insurers, according to Clarissa Franks, risk management placement leader at insurance broker Marsh in London. \n Communicable diseases will typically only be covered if airlines\u00a0have taken out specialist coverage. But that would come at a cost that probably outweighs the risk-benefit return, Franks\u00a0said. \n RIPPLE EFFECTS \n It is too early to determine overall costs to the insurance industry from the deadly coronavirus, experts said. \n The reinsurance market at Lloyd's of London has not seen any untoward activity from traditional insurers looking to hedge their exposure to risks arising from this outbreak, two sources in the underwriting trade said. \n But even if they are not covered for communicable diseases specifically, companies will be checking the fine print as ripple effects flow through their China operations and global supply chains, following Beijing's decision to quarantine entire cities. \n As with SARS and other pandemics of recent years such as swine flu, Zika and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the industry will be \"paying very close attention to this\", Association of British Insurers spokesman Malcolm Tarling said. \n He cautioned individuals and companies: \"If someone travels (to China) against government advice, then most policies will be invalidated. If you believe your trip is essential, you need to talk to your insurer first.\" \n  \n RISK CALCULUS \n The closest analogy is SARS, which first broke out in China in 2002 and led to a slew of disputes between companies and their insurance providers. \n For the travel industry alone, the impact of SARS was estimated by the World Travel and Tourism Council at US$30 billion to US$50 billion. \n But China's economy accounted for 5 per cent of the global gross domestic product then, compared to nearly a fifth today, according to World Bank data. \n More Chinese now travel abroad than any other nationality, and they spend the most on average while away. \n The number of infections from the new virus stands at more than 20,000, and the World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency. \n But health experts stress its mortality rate among patients is lower than for SARS. \n In a blog, Risk Management Solutions noted that several sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled in China, \"and all risk stakeholders will be anxious over the number of months before 2019-nCoV (the novel coronavirus) is contained\". \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram "}, {"content": "British PM Boris Johnson calls PM Narendra Modi to discuss coronavirus crisis.

SINGAPORE \u2014 A link between two Covid-19 church clusters, where the source of infection had previously eluded the authorities, was finally established. This was done through a serological test, a new testing method developed by Duke-NUS Medical School.\u00a0 \n The test is able to detect past infections in someone\u00a0who has recovered from it. Individuals\u00a0who had contracted\u00a0the coronovirus before will have high levels of virus-specific antibodies in their blood which can be picked up by this test.\u00a0\u00a0 \n The authorities ran\u00a0this test on Case 83, a 54 year-old Singaporean man,\u00a0and Case 91, a 58-year-old Singaporean woman and the latest case to be announced on Tuesday (Feb 25). They then discovered that both of them\u00a0had earlier contracted Covid-19 but were\u00a0not detected at the time. \n They also found\u00a0that the two, who are married,\u00a0had a link with\u00a0another married couple from Wuhan (Cases 8 and 9) who had visited Life Church and Missions Singapore. Both couples were there on the same day on Jan 19. \n Case 91, the wife,\u00a0developed symptoms on Jan 23 and Case 83, the husband, had symptoms on Jan 28. \n On Jan 25, both of them\u00a0attended a Chinese New Year gathering on Mei Hwan Drive near Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 which other confirmed cases attended, including Case 66, a 28-year-old Singaporean man who worked at Grace Assembly of God church.\u00a0 \n On Feb 1, 6\u00a0and 10, the wife\u00a0sought treatment at a general practitioner (GP) clinic. \n At the same time, records also showed that her husband\u00a0had gone to see a GP\u00a0repeatedly on Feb 1, 5, 6 and 10.\u00a0 \n During the period under investigations later, the couple\u00a0were not sick\u00a0and did not show symptoms, but records by the Ministry of Health (MOH) showed that the wife\u00a0had gone to the emergency department of Sengkang General Hospital earlier on Jan 26 with symptoms consistent with Covid-19.\u00a0 \n She was not marked\u00a0as a suspect case at the time\u00a0because she had no recent travel history to China. The case definition has since been expanded to include those who have not been to\u00a0China in the last 14 days. \n On Feb 18, both of them showed up\u00a0at\u00a0the National Centre for Infectious Diseases\u00a0to undergo tests, including the\u00a0serological tests. It\u00a0was then confirmed that they had earlier been infected with the virus. On Feb 19, results showed that the husband had\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0while results for the wife were\u00a0confirmed\u00a0on Feb 22. \n Together with help from the police doing contact tracing, the authorities\u00a0found that the Chinese New Year gathering on\u00a0Mei Hwan Drive was the common event that this Singaporean couple\u00a0attended together with Case 66\u00a0from the Grace Assembly of God church. \n  Illustration: Samuel Woo/TODAY \n As of Tuesday, there are\u00a023\u00a0cases from the Grace Assembly of God cluster \u2014 making it the biggest cluster \u2014 and seven cases from\u00a0Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar.\u00a0 \n Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at MOH, said that the serological tests gave the authorities the confidence to establish that the cases reported at the Grace Assembly of God cluster was not a case of widespread community transmission from other sources. \n Rather, it was a result of a sequential series of events, he\u00a0said at a media briefing on Tuesday by the multi-ministry task force\u00a0managing the public health crisis. \n MOH said that the spread between the clusters started with Case\u00a08 (a 56 year-old woman) and Case 9 (a 56 year-old man), who are Chinese nationals.\u00a0 \n The couple arrived in Singapore on Jan 19 from Wuhan, China \u2014 the epicentre of the outbreak.\u00a0\u00a0 \n They likely infected the Singaporean couple who\u00a0went on to pass the infection to Case 66 at the Chinese New Year gathering, the ministry said. Case 66 later\u00a0passed the infection to his colleagues at Grace Assembly of God church. \n Case 66\u00a0was thus found to be the primary case in the Grace Assembly of God\u00a0cluster.\u00a0 \n Some people were exposed to him\u00a0at a staff meeting at the Tanglin branch of the church and they in turn infected other church members, MOH said.\u00a0 \n Writing on Facebook, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the authorities \u201cdiscovered an important link\u201d between two existing clusters, including the biggest cluster at Grace Assembly of God.\u00a0 \n He noted that Cases\u00a083 and 91 had only mild symptoms earlier\u00a0and had not been diagnosed with Covid-19. But the new serological test later\u00a0confirmed that they had been infected earlier, and linked the two clusters together.\u00a0 \n \u201cThis breakthrough would not have been possible without close cooperation among the Ministry of Health, Singapore Police Force and researchers from Duke-NUS Medical School, who developed the serological test, the world's first, here in Singapore.

Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan\u2019s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for Sars patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore.\u00a0 \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added.\u00a0 \n \u201cThe healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes.

So far, in the context of this mechanism, Brussels has already supported the repatriation of 400 EU citizens in China, on planes organized by France and Germany.\nCited by the note, the European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, points out that \"the EU continues to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, both to support Member States such as China.\" \"Currently, we are still working to send groceries to China in the next few days,\" says the person in charge.\nAbout 500 passengers left this Wednesday the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is moored in Yokohama, Japan, after a two-week quarantine due to the new Coronavirus (Covid-19). Quarantine, much criticized by the passengers confined to the ship, could not avoid the contagion of more than 600 people aboard.\nThe failure of quarantine was underlined when authorities today announced more 79 cases of contagion by the new coronavirus, IVE19, raising the total on the ship to 621.

PARIS/WASHINGTON - Business activity collapsed from Australia, Japan and Western Europe to the United States at a record pace in March as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic hammer the world economy, cementing economists' views of a deep global recession.  \n The highly contagious coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has caused entire regions to be placed on lockdown and in some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking supply chains.  \n \"The global health crisis is rapidly morphing into a global recession, as there is a clear tension between preventing infections and ruining the economy,\" said Edoardo Campanella, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Milan. \"However, a wise policy coordination between health and fiscal authorities should allow a V-shaped recovery once containment measures are relaxed.\"  \n Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to a reading of 40.5 this month. That was an all-time low and followed a reading of 49.6 in February.  \n Last month's decline in the index, which is seen as a good measure of economic health, was the largest in the series' history. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in business activity. The survey underscored the rapidly deteriorating economy, highlighted last week by a government report showing the biggest rise since 2012 in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits during the week ended March 14.  \n Economists are predicting claims will accelerate to a record 1.5 million or more when data for last week is published on Thursday.  \n The message was equally grim from the 19 countries that use the euro. IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone plummeted to a record low of 31.4 in March.  \n That was by far the biggest one-month fall since the survey began in mid-1998 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of 38.8.  \n In France, services activity fell to a record low and manufacturing saw its steepest drop since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.  \n A PMI for the services sector in Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed a record contraction in activity, while sister surveys showed Britain's economy shrinking at a record pace.  \n IHS Markit said the March figures suggested the euro zone economy was shrinking at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus could steepen the downturn.  \n With most asset markets tanking, global central banks have been rolling out extraordinary measures on an almost daily basis to stop the rot. But some analysts say infinite monetary policy easing may not be enough and fiscal steps are crucial.  \n There was some optimism on that front, with senior Democrats and Republicans saying on Tuesday they were close to reaching a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to aid the U.S. economy.  \n Hopes for a large fiscal stimulus sparked a sharp rebound in global stock markets , with the Dow Jones <.DJI> raking up its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933.

Given rising infections and death toll, health experts, economists and politicians have cautioned against such a move, which they say could backfire, with Americans remaining fearful of going out.  \n Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with major Wall Street investors on Tuesday.  \n \"Sending the public back to work at this time would be premature,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York. \"The U.S. is better off taking a one-time hit to economic growth, as efforts to terminate the virus continue, rather than run the risk of multiple economic shutdowns.\" (Graphic: U.S. stocks have fallen hard - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3867/3828/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n Mirroring the emptying of supermarket shelves around the world, indebted corporates have rushed into money markets to hoard dollars, with a global shortage of dollar funding threatening to cripple firms from airlines to retailers.  \n PMI surveys from Japan showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record this month and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade.  \n This was consistent with a 4% contraction in 2020, Capital Economics senior economist Marcel Theliant said. The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to deal a heavy blow to the world's third-largest economy.  \n The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday promised bottomless dollar funding and an array of programs to help keep companies afloat. For the first time, the Fed will back purchases of corporate bonds, backstop direct loans to companies and \"soon\" will roll out a programme to get credit to small and medium-sized businesses. It will also expand its asset purchases by \"as much as needed.\"  \n The Fed last week slashed borrowing costs to zero and took other emergency steps to keep the commercial paper, U.S. Treasury debt and foreign dollar funding markets functional.  \n G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on Tuesday pledged to expand fiscal and monetary actions for as long as necessary to restore growth and confidence.  \n With the International Monetary Fund predicting a global recession, the world's 20 largest economies agreed on Monday to develop an \"action plan,\" but without specifics.

It is a new pathogen, and scientists know little about it. \n Fear of the unknown is a very human trait that has helped keep our species alive through the millennia.

Unfortunately, they are error-prone. \n The availability heuristic is used when we make judgements about the likelihood of something. Quite often, the judgements we arrive at turn out to be inaccurate. \n A classic example is this: We tend to be afraid of flying in airplanes but not riding in cars. But statistically speaking, we are more likely to die in a car accident than a plane crash. \n Why does the availability heuristic make such mistakes? This is because it judges how likely something is based on how easy it is to think of examples of that thing happening. \n We can think of many examples of fatal plane crashes because such incidents tend to be widely covered by the media. \n But traffic accidents usually go unnoticed because they are an everyday occurrence and the media rarely covers them unless they involve multiple casualties or cause significant damage. \n The influence of the availability heuristic was very apparent in another epidemic \u2014\u00a0the 2009 swine flu, caused by the Influenza A H1N1 virus. \n I was only 12 then, and I remember how the grownups, their eyes glued to the day\u2019s newspaper, spoke to one another in hushed tones about how bad the pandemic was and how many people were dying. \n Eventually, I caught the bug. But it was nothing a three-day stay in an isolation ward and a brief course of Tamiflu couldn\u2019t fix. \n H1N1 is still around today, but has faded into obscurity. It is now just another flu virus \u2014\u00a0one of dozens responsible for the seasonal flu. \n Of course, we now know that the 2009 variant of H1N1 was a relatively mild strain. It infected up to 200 million people but its mortality rate was a modest 0.02 per cent.\u00a0The mortality rate in Singapore was even lower at 0.004 per cent , with 18 fatalities from some 415,000 cases. \n It was a good illustration of how people\u2019s imagined fears, fuelled by media coverage, can make a relatively small problem seem like a huge one thanks to the availability heuristic. \n It\u2019s hard not to overestimate your likelihood of dying from H1N1 if you\u2019re constantly reading reports about how thousands have already succumbed. \n To put the numbers in context, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) viruses \u2014\u00a0which are cousins of 2019-nCoV \u2014\u00a0have a 10 per cent and 34 per cent mortality rate respectively. \n The mortality rate of 2019-nCoV itself stands at below 3 per cent for now, though this could change if new information emerges about the virus or if it mutates into a more dangerous form. \n Meanwhile, the humble seasonal flu sickens up to a billion people \u2014\u00a0equivalent to roughly 15 per cent of the world\u2019s population \u2014\u00a0every year, killing up to 650,000. \n Although this works out to a mortality rate of less than 1 per cent, the sheer number of cases means that even now, we are far more likely to come down with \u2014\u00a0and subsequently die from \u2014\u00a0the regular flu than the Wuhan virus. \n So if you see someone coughing, keep your mind in check. Don\u2019t immediately assume that they have the Wuhan virus. It\u2019s probably just the regular flu. \n And when you are thinking and discussing with others about the outbreak, do your best to seek out the facts and use logical reasoning. \n Because the virus is new and little is known about it, people may fill the void of information with speculation and hearsay. \n It has already happened here. Fake news that individuals had died from the virus in Singapore has circulated on at least two occasions, forcing the Government to debunk the misinformation and even issue a general correction direction through the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act\u00a0Office. \n It can be very tempting to share such rumours with family and friends, because they are dramatic and prey on our emotions. \n But apply some media literacy techniques first, before deciding whether to press the \u201csend\u201d button. \n Read about past epidemics and how viruses work on free information platforms like Wikipedia. Consume news from multiple outlets so you can corroborate the facts across different sources. \n As Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Jan 27 at a press conference about the Wuhan virus situation in Singapore: \u201cThis is not just a fight on the medical front, but a fight on the psychological front. We have to stay together, and do not panic.\u201d \n In short, let\u2019s not scare ourselves unnecessarily, and refrain from scaring one another too. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Jonathan Tiong is a fourth-year student at the National University of Singapore where he is majoring in Communications and New Media.

LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Three separate research teams backed by a global coalition set up to fight epidemic diseases are to start work on developing potential vaccines against the new coronavirus that has caused a disease outbreak in China.\nDeveloping new vaccines has traditionally taken up to a decade, but the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is funding two of the projects and co-funding the third, said the aim now is to work much faster.\nIts plan is to have at least one potential vaccine in clinical trials by June, offering the chance that a shot could fully developed, tested and approved for use in a year.\nThe research will be conducted by drug and vaccine developer Moderna working with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the U.S. firm Inovio Pharma; and a team at the University of Queensland, Australia.\nThe new coronavirus, known as nCoV-2019, first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan but cases have been detected as far away as the United States. It has killed 17 people and infected more than 600.\nEach of the three projects will test a distinct scientific approach to developing a preventative vaccine.\n\u201cOur aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks,\u201d said Richard Hatchett, CEPI\u2019s chief executive.\n\u201cThere are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work could provide a significant and important step forward in developing a vaccine for this disease.\u201d\nCEPI\u2019s hope is to enable vaccine platform technology that has already been advanced for other infectious diseases such as MERS and Ebola to be used to hasten progress, Hatchett said.\nVaccine platforms are based on using the same fundamental components as a framework, and adapting them for use against different pathogens by inserting new gene sequences.\nInfectious disease epidemics such as Ebola outbreaks in Africa, the Zika outbreak that spread from Brazil, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, are sporadic, unpredictable and fast-moving. Yet developing vaccines to combat them has traditionally taken up to 10 years or more.\nCEPI was set up at the start of 2017 with the aim of dramatically speeding up the process of developing of vaccines against new and unknown diseases.

LONDON - Extending school and work closures at the coronavirus' ground zero in China may delay a second wave of infections, researchers said on Thursday, urging the rest of the world to take note.  \n With containment measures largely successful and the epidemic's epicentre now in Europe, China has loosened a two-month lockdown in the city of Wuhan where the new coronavirus is thought to have jumped from wildlife to people late last year.  \n But a study in The Lancet Public Health journal suggested continuing Wuhan's shutdowns until April would push a potential second wave of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the new virus - until later in the year. That would give health services more time to recover and expand, potentially saving lives.  \n \"The city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases,\" said Kiesha Prem, a specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who co-led the research.  \n \"If they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.\"  \n The study used mathematical modelling to simulate either extending or relaxing school and workplace closures in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people whose name has become synonymous with the coronavirus for much of the world.  \n By lifting control measures now, a second rush of infections may occur in late August, the analysis suggested. But keeping lockdown measures until April would likely delay a second peak until October \u2014 giving healthcare workers a chance to regroup.  \n  \n RESURGENCE FEARS  \n Those findings were \"crucial for policy makers everywhere\", said Tim Colbourn, an expert in global health epidemiology at University College London, who was not directly involved in the study.  \n Stunned by the disease's rapid spread, governments around the world are trying to replicate China's draconian lockdown measures while also working out the risk of recurrences once the epidemic peaks have passed in their countries.  \n \"Our results won't look exactly the same in another country,\" said Yang Liu, an LSHTM expert who also worked on the research. \"But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection ... If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems.\"  \n World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday expressed the same view, saying lockdowns were the best way to curb transmission.  \n \"The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,\" he said.

BEIJING/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK - China is withdrawing the press credentials of American journalists at three U.S. newspapers, intensifying a bitter fight between the world's top two economies that has widened to include the coronavirus outbreak and media freedoms.  \n Beijing announced on Wednesday what it said was retaliation against U.S. restrictions on Chinese journalists that includes revoking the accreditations of American correspondents with the New York Times <NYT.N>, News Corp's <NWSA.O> Wall Street Journal and Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.  \n The move is a sharp escalation of a dispute that saw Washington last month force Chinese state media firms to register as foreign embassies.  \n Beijing then expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents - two Americans and an Australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called China the \"real sick man of Asia.\"  \n Washington then slashed the number of journalists permitted to work in the United States at four major Chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. It cited a \"deepening crackdown\" on independent reporting inside China.  \n Beijing said the expelled journalists would not be permitted to work in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. It said they must hand back their press cards within 10 days.  \n The expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which said it \"deplores\" China's decision.  \n China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on how many journalists are affected.  \n Beijing also said the China branches of the three papers plus the Voice of America broadcaster and Time magazine must \"declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.\"  \n  \n WAR OF WORDS  \n The latest development follows a war of words between Washington and Beijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness COVID-19.  \n The virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people globally, bringing normal life in many parts of the world to a standstill.  \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference that Beijing's move on Wednesday would deprive the world and the Chinese people of information in \"incredibly challenging\" times brought about by the coronavirus.  \n \"I regret China's decision today to further foreclose the world's ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people,\" he said. \"This is unfortunate... I hope they'll reconsider.\"  \n Media executives denounced the move.  \n \"We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel U.S. reporters,\" Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said in a statement. \"The Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis , when clear and reliable information about the international response to COVID-19 is essential.\"  \n Dean Baquet, executive editor at The New York Times, also condemned the decision.  \n \"It is a grave mistake for China to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world's top news organizations,\" he said.  \n Matt Murray, editor in chief at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, said: \"We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world. Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.\"  \n Time Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal said: \"We oppose any effort by the Chinese government or any other government to expel reporters or intimidate those whose job is to provide accurate information, especially during this crucial period for the world.\"  \n A representative of Voice of America was not immediately reachable.  \n  \n 'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS'  \n A striking aspect of Beijing's move was its decision to bar the journalists from working in Hong Kong and Macau, two semi-autonomous territories of China with their own media accreditation rules. In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of China were allowed to work in Hong Kong.  \n That raised questions about Hong Kong's autonomy under the \"one country, two systems\" agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland.  \n \"There's no precedent for China dictating who can and can\u2019t report from Hong Kong openly,\" said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists' Asia programme coordinator. \"It very seriously erodes Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and freedom of the press.\"  \n The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club in Hong Kong said it was alarmed at the decision to expel the journalists and even more concerned that they would be banned from working as journalists in Hong Kong.  \n It said Hong Kong must provide assurances that foreign journalists working in Hong Kong and those applying to work in the city will continue to be issued employment visas without interference from the Chinese government.  \n Beijing said on Wednesday that its actions \"are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States.\"  \n Pompeo said he did not think Beijing's latest move was a balanced response. \"This isn't apples to apples,\" he said, charging that the Chinese journalists who had faced restrictions were part of \"propaganda outlets.\"  \n China has repeatedly denounced the Wall Street Journal's \"sick man\" column as racist and, after the newspaper declined to apologise, revoked the visas of the three reporters in Beijing.

The propagation of Covid-19 and the imminence of a large pandemic can affect global geopolitics and is placing governments to social problems difficult to solve. Analysts heard by the Agency Lusa believe that a pandemic can create situations of \"pandemonium\" and emphasize that several rulers fear the social repercussion of the uncontrolled spread of the virus in a \"global village\" where phenomena do not recognize borders.\nA visible case of this concern is the US President: Worried about the impact of the new coronavirus in his re-election attempt in November near Trump prevented a US citizen who had been infected on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan to be treated In his home state of Alabama, phoning the Republican Senator Richard Shelby, to ensure compliance with his instruction.\nAnalysts say that the impact of Covid-19 in US elections can be a \"double-edged knife\": In a first hypothesis, the US economy is affected in the long run, frailing the position of Trump, which has used the flag economic performance; In a second scenario, the outbreak has a short duration, affecting the production of goods for a few months, with the offer to resume on the eve of the election, in a compressed way, favoring the position of Trump.\nAccording to the North American newspaper, Trump already asked its advisors to analyze all the scenarios and requested a detailed report on emergency measures to the control and disease prevention center (CDC). The CDC, in a document made public, warned the American president on the risk of \"the public health system to stay overwhelmed, with high hospitalization rates and deaths,\" alerting also for the impact of a pandemic in transport systems.\nThe problem is global and the great variable is to know what dimension he will reach, says Jos\u00e9 Pedro Teixeira Fernandes, investigator of the Portuguese Institute of International Relations (IPRI-Nova). In statements to Lusa, this specialist alerts to the risks that governments run if a pandemic spreads for long periods of time.\n\"The problem is grade,\" explains Teixeira Fernandes, referring to a situation that can involve many thousands of infected one country for a long period, affecting not only health services, but also the supply chains of goods essential.\nFor already, in Europe, where cases of infection begin to multiply in various regions, governments seek containment mechanisms of the disease, triggering administrative virus insulation mechanisms.\nEven in France, where there is a strong tradition of individual rights - which make it impossible for, for example, that a person who decides to disappear can not be sought by the police, even under the pretext of \"family interest\" - the government announced that it will carry out the obligation to Internment for infected people.\nThe theme of mandatory hospitalization of an infected patient with a highly contagious virus is being discussed in several countries , including Portugal, where experts are divided into the legal reading of solutions.\nConstantine Sakellarides, a public health specialist and who was responsible for the General Health Directorate in Portugal, stated that Portuguese law enables a compulsory quarantine of a patient infected with viruses and even provides for the possibility of declaring the state of calamity, which be proposed by the Government to the President of the Republic.\nIn contrast, Francisco George, who was also General Health Director, considers that it will be necessary to make amendments to the Constitution to establish compulsory hospitalization for public health reasons. \"In Portugal, it is the height of Members of the Assembly of the Republic to amend Article 27 (3) (h) of the Constitution, in order to become allowed compulsory hospitalization for public health reasons. Inadapiatico,\" wrote Francisco George, in a recently released opinion article in public diary.\nCaroline Barnett, a public health professor at the University of Paris, says that the risk of this gender measures increases with the size of the problem. \"The problem is when the state seeks mandatory hospitalization of hundreds or thousands of people, often without ensuring the appropriate conditions for all these hospitalizations,\" said Barnett to Lusa, referring to a scenario that may occur in several countries, short term.\nFor this specialist, an uncontrolled situation of virus propagation may lead to a political \"pandemonium\", with several governments to have to recognize the inability to deal with thousands of deaths and health systems in the media to welcome millions of infected.\nIn Europe, the European Commission seeks less intrusive solutions than compulsory hospitalization with virus spread isolation mechanisms that avoid the need for compulsive hospitalization, in particular by activating European civil protection pool - an organization established to streamline a coordination of efforts between member countries for rapid response to disasters.\nA relevant political decision in the European Community concerns the closure of borders in the Schengen area, which the European Commission said this week is not yet being considered. The European Commissioner for Health and Food Security Stella Kyriakides said that the World Health Organization did not advise restrictions in Europe to justify the removal of this solution.\nJos\u00e9 Pedro Teixeira Fernandes Remember that a measure of this genre goes against Schengen's own spirit, but recognizes that an emergency situation can justify it for a short period of time.\nThe governments of Italy and France, whose countries bordered, have announced that they are attentive to this possibility, after the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Veneto if they have been heavily affected by the spread of the new coronavirus. Moreover, the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Count, has been criticized by the regional authorities by the most relaxed form as the coronavirus issue has addressed, criticizing local decisions of closures of schools and other public spaces.\nCount tried to avoid fears that his government was not able to contain the virus, after being forced to admit that a hospital in northern Italy had defeated a case of infection, contributing to the spread of Covid-19.\nPolitically, the most delicate border is the one that separates Italy from Austria, two countries that are in confrontation open around the discussion of the European budget and also seem to have different visions on the best way to contain coronavirus. The Austrian Government has already signed that I would like to see the best-wiped borders, but the Italian government has already said that it does not see reasons to suspend Schengen, asking the European Commission to quickly release the Fund of EUR 232 million to contain the propagation of the Covid-19.\nDiplomatically, the problem is also to serve as a pretext to regulate the growing flow of Chinese tourists in some Asian regions. The authorities of Singapore are locking the entry of Chinese in the territory, after the business minister and the industry of this territory announced that the tourism area was overly dependent on China, using virus protection measures to justify measures to medium and long term in moderation of your entry.\nTeixeira Fernandes recalls that Cuvid-19 case is a strong threat to China's position, initial focus of the epidemic, at the time he is launching his economic expansion program, especially before the United States, with whom he maintains a commercial war For almost two years.\nThe EPI-Nova specialist still remembers another case of a country conflict with the United States, Iran, who is also arms with a serious problem of spreading the virus, which will also be fragile before its enemies.

If this trend continues, I wrote the Environment Editor of the \"Guardian\", Jonathan Watts, two weeks ago, world emissions may fall to 2008/09, before the financial crisis.\nEven the drastic reduction of travel house-work and work-home, a little throughout Europe, are not to discount in the equation. \"The idea that we need to move, every day, to a central place to work can be a result of inertia, more than anything else. Confronted with the real need to move around the mouse [of the computer], instead of the car, we may discover that the benefits of labor flexibility extend to everything from the consumption of gasoline to the need for large parking lots in the offices , said American environmentalist Bill McKibben to the British diary.\nHowever, if it is true that emissions - at the industrial and aviation level - are falling on the pique, the increase in the energy consumption of citizens who are quarantined also in the balance of emissions. \"If you come to a cold house and you have to warm up, this will imply costs that, on average, will not compensate for the savings of not having to drive to work,\" Christopher Jones, specialist in climate politics at the University of California, explained to \"Scientific American\" magazine.\nA coincidence: In 2016, the United Nations determined that the limit that would be imposed on carbon emissions on international flights would be based on the values \u200b\u200brecorded in the year 2020. The expectation was that airlines continued to grow - and emissions from CO2 also, of course - and was established thus a ceiling; Since 2013, emissions increased by 26%, note.\nNow due to Covid-19, almost for decades that did not exist so few airplanes in the air, and emissions were so low, note the \"independent\". World air traffic fell 4.3% in February; In China, the number was more radical: 70%.\nThe pandemic means significantly the average volume of CO2 emissions. The number of airplanes in the air - at least at European level - is minimal. \"A possible beneficial result of the virus, if we can see some light in this tragedy, is that the baseline [determined by the UN] is 2020 and at this time aviation is a kind of line-line,\" said Katherine Kramer, Climate change in the Christian Aid Association in the British Parliament, Wednesday.\nThat is, when you reach the end of the year if there is no change in the United Nations calendar, the \"emissions baseline will be much lower\" than it was expected four years ago, she explained. Remember: Aviation is one of the most contributed sectors to climate change: in 2018, domestic and international flights issued around 895 million tons of CO2.

Unlike several countries, namely European, Portugal has not provided for an automatic quarantine for repatriated citizens due to the outbreak of coronavirus - which would be unconstitutional, because it is only foreseen for cases of the psychiatric forum.

This includes doctors, whose number depends on the amount of \"suspicious or confirmed cases\" that are referred and their characteristics, \"namely if adults or children and degree of gravity.\"\nSimilar to what will happen at Hospital Curry Cabral, hospital health professionals in the port that pays care to these patients will have to use \"individual protection equipment appropriate to the type and risk of transmission of this agent\" which, \"depending on the activity It will exercise, \"will pass through the use of\" masks, bats, gloves and eye protection (glasses or visors).\nAlthough the plan is specific - for being a new virus and, as such, with \"own characteristics\" - the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Hospital admits that there are points of contact with previous diseases such as bird flu or flu A. \" There are naturally similarities with previous emerging diseases in the way it transmits, as has been given the evolution of epidemic and in terms of public health and control measures, \"admit.\nFernando Maltez adds that Curry Cabral already \"activated several contingency plans for other threats of infectious diseases\" and that these plans \"are being modified and updated\" with changes to the level of personal protective equipment, as happened with the Ebola outbreak which originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, \"which is transmitted by contact with any organic fluid\" and not \"only by respiratory route\", as in the case of coronavirus.\nAs for the precautions to be taken, the specialist states that they are the same as in a case of influenza, including for the people living with the Portuguese who will be removed from Wuhan - everything indicates that this Friday - and placed under surveillance at home for a period of 14 days, through a case-by-case analysis.\n\"These citizens do not need to stay home alone, being able to live with family and friends since they use mask and lay their hands.

But it said it would ensure that inflation remains within its fresh target.\nOn the recent budget announcements, RBI said income tax concessions under the new optional regime will help boost domestic demand and welcomed the government\u2019s infrastructure push.\nShaktikanta Das also admitted that RBI is concerned about the recent developments on global trade due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nHere are some key takeaways from RBI\u2019s sixth bi-monthly monetary policy review in 2019-20.\nOutput gap negative\nThough RBI expects private consumption to drive growth in the upcoming fiscal, it says the output gap remains negative in the present scenario due to a mix of domestic and global economic factors. While RBI did not opt for a rate cut, Governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank has enough tools at its disposal to act if economy weakens further.\nFY21 growth outlook\nRBI has estimated GDP growth at 6 per cent for 2020-21. For the first six months of the next fiscal, growth has been predicted at 5.6-6.2 per cent while 6.2 per cent rate has been estimated for the third quarter of FY21. RBI\u2019s projection indicates that an economic recovery can be expected by the second half of 2020-21, given there is a steady decline in inflation and other domestic disturbances.\nBudget commentary\nShaktikanta Das said the RBI welcomed decisions taken by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Budget 2020-21, especially on the tax front and the government\u2019s infrastructure outlay. He said the income tax concessions under the optional income tax rate will boost consumer demand while the infra push was in line with higher rural spending.\nCoronavirus concern \nThe Reserve Bank of India expressed serious concern over the coronavirus outbreak in China with respect to global trade. It said the rapidly spreading virus, which has globally claimed than 500 lives, may even impact India\u2019s economy adversely. However, Governor Das said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak is uncertain till now. He also called for a rapid action plan to deal with the growing trade drawbacks due to the outbreak. In India, there are no new cases of coronavirus after three from Kerala were diagnosed positive. But businesses in India are already facing the heat of the outbreak. The diamond industry in Surat says it could lose business up to Rs 8,000 crore as key markets continue to remain shut. Companies from all sectors who import materials from China are also facing the heat.\nInflation projection hiked\nRBI continues to remain worried about inflation , especially since demand for food commodities have increased globally after the coronavirus outbreak. RBI has projected CPI inflation upwards to 6.5 per cent for the present quarter and 5.4 per cent for the first half of FY21, which is expected to go down to 3.21 per cent in the third quarter of FY21. While inflation projection has been increased from the earlier policy review, inflation is expected to come down as a result of falling vegetable prices, especially onions. A better Rabi sowing season may also contain inflation.\nDon\u2019t Discount RBI \nRBI said its policy stance should not be seen as a future policy action and that it has many ways of tackling economic growth when required. Shaktikanta Das said RBI will continue to maintain an accommodative stance, indicating that it will act whenever necessary to beat slowdown. Have many instruments at our disposal to address slowdown, Das said.\nSmall saving schemes interest rates \nThe RBI\u2019s MPC also indicated that there is a need for adjustment in interest rates for small savings schemes. Small savings school include the Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC) and others. It remains to be seen whether the government acts on the RBI\u2019s advice.\nGood Rabi sowing\nAnother positive mentioned by the MPC is higher Rabi sowing of 9.5 per cent up to January 31. Production of vegetables was also estimated to go up by 2.6 per cent, as per the MPC. This is a good indication as it could lead to moderation in the prices of vegetables.\nBetter indicators \nWhile there are some existing factors that need to be addressed, RBI said there has been an improvement in industrial activity. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), prepared by IHS Markit, rose from 52.7 in December 2019 to 55.3 in January 2020. India\u2019s service sector activity also touched a seven-year high in January, indicating a recovery. Apart from all these factors, RBI said private investment is also likely to grow in the next fiscal. "}, {"content": "Cuvid-19: WHO warns that young \"are not invincible\".

Today, the administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,\" said Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.  \n The money will be used for therapeutics, vaccine development and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment such as masks, the White House said.  \n Of the $2.5 billion request, $1.5 billion represents new funding. The rest would come from funds already budgeted by Congress, such as unused money to fight the Ebola virus. The administration requires congressional approval to redirect that money to fight the coronavirus.  \n House of Representatives Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a Democrat, said in a statement the Trump administration's funding request was \"woefully insufficient to protect Americans from the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\"  \n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late on Monday that the supplemental funding requested by Trump is \"undersized\" and \"completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency\".  \n \"The House will swiftly advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis,\" Pelosi said in a statement.  \n The United States has not seen the virus spread through its communities the way that China and other countries have experienced, but health officials are preparing for the possibility even as Americans affected so far have been quarantined.  \n There have been 53 confirmed U.S. cases of the new coronavirus so far - 14 in people diagnosed in the United States and 39 among Americans repatriated from the outbreak's epicentre of Wuhan, China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \n  \n TRAVEL WARNING  \n U.S. health officials have warned that cases among repatriated citizens will likely increase.  \n The CDC warned Americans on Monday to avoid travel to South Korea because of the virus.  \n \"We have aggressively worked to combat the spread of this virus, tried to prevent it as best we could from coming into this country,\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters earlier on Monday.  \n Trump has been at odds with his own White House advisers over China's coronavirus response. He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.  \n Trump has praised the work of Chinese President Xi Jinping, even as his advisers have questioned the reliability of the information Beijing has shared on the virus and expressed frustration over its reluctance to accept U.S. expertise in combating it.  \n The Trump administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.  \n In a statement on Monday, HHS cited a \"rapidly evolving situation,\" but said the Alabama centre was \"not needed at this time\" and that it was looking for alternatives.

SINGAPORE - An estimated 20 per cent of the people infected with the Wuhan virus will become very ill, such as with more severe pneumonia, says a Singapore infectious diseases expert. \n That is the current estimate and this may change when more is known about the Wuhan coronavirus, also known as the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), says Dr Shawn Vasoo, the acting clinical director at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). \n There are currently four confirmed cases of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Singapore. The patients had all travelled from China where the virus is spreading fast. \n With concerns growing, The Straits Times asked Dr Vasoo to explain what else is known about the virus that has so far reportedly killed more than 50 people in China. \n A: In some people, the virus infects the lower respiratory tract (lungs) and this results in pneumonia. Not everyone will get pneumonia but in most diagnosed cases so far, pneumonia, of varying severities, has been commonly described. \n A: As there are currently no proven specific anti-viral medications for the 2019-novel coronavirus, one overcomes the infection with our immune system, and recovers thereafter. \n Not all cases of pneumonia are severe, but most patients who have fared poorly are those who have gone on to develop severe pneumonia. \n Severe cases may have more concurrent chronic medical problems such as cardiovascular disease or lung disease. \n Currently, an estimated 20 per cent of the people infected with the 2019-novel coronavirus will become very ill (more severe pneumonia). However, this estimate may change as we learn more about this disease. \n A: The common symptoms include fever, cough, in more severe cases, shortness of breath, especially when there is pneumonia. Occasionally some symptoms may be absent, for example fever. \n A: It is not possible to distinguish clearly between the common cold, influenza and the 2019-novel coronavirus. \n Even influenza, which is more common, can lead to severe disease and pneumonia. It also causes death. \n However, unlike in Wuhan, there is currently no widespread community transmission in Singapore. \n Hence, we would be concerned about a possible 2019-novel coronavirus infection only if one has travelled to China or if one has been in contact with a known case of the infection. \n As for dengue, respiratory symptoms are less common and fever, rash, muscle aches and headaches are more common. \n A: You should seek medical attention if you are not feeling well in general, particularly if symptoms have not improved in two to three days. You should seek immediate medical attention if you have risk factors for the 2019-novel coronavirus as described above, so your doctor can assess you. \n A: If you have symptoms you can see your family doctor or polyclinic who will make the initial assessment. \n If more urgent medical attention is needed, or if it is a medical emergency, you should seek medical attention at the nearest emergency clinic or hospital. \n A: Avoid travelling to affected areas, in particular the Hubei province. If you are travelling to China, you should exercise caution and observe good hand hygiene (hand washing or use of hand sanitisers) and avoid crowded places. \n A photo of a man with a mask on at Plaza Singapura MRT on Jan 26, 2020. ST PHOTO: KELLY HUI \n A: As infection by the 2019-novel coronavirus and other common respiratory viruses are spread by respiratory droplets carrying the virus, surgical masks can prevent inhalation of these droplets. \n You should wear a surgical mask if you are ill to prevent spreading whatever respiratory virus you have to others (this is most commonly influenza and the common cold viruses). This is part of being civic conscious. \n Surgical masks may help prevent infection from respiratory viruses in general, if one is around sick people. \n Those who are more prone to infection, such as the elderly or those with poor immune systems, would want to consider wearing them. \n I would discourage the routine use of N95 masks as mask fitting is typically required for its proper use. \n It is also more stuffy and uncomfortable if used for prolonged periods, and may actually be less effective than a surgical mask if used improperly. \n There is no known transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in the community in Singapore at this point, so the routine use of a mask to prevent this particular infection is probably unnecessary. \n However, If you are going to an affected area, you should strongly consider the use of a surgical face mask. \n A: This may vary, as patients have developed symptoms as early as in two days while others may develop symptoms later, for example in 10 to 14 days. The average is estimated to be about one week. \n A: You are most likely infectious when you have symptoms, in particular fever and cough.

What is done to narrow the spread and what is known about the virus and the disease?\nAccording to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), a further import of cases to Germany must be expected. Other transfers of SARS COV-2, infection chains and outbreaks in the country are possible. Local infections could initially remain unrecognized, said Vice President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lars Schaade, on Wednesday in the RBB. It is \"quite possible that we do not recognize all these outbreaks immediately\". It is necessary to expect that thereby coming to another spread. The risk to the health of the population in Germany currently appreciate the experts as low to moderate.\nAn infection wave in this country could include full waiting areas and medical practices, intensive care beds and fully overloaded health insurance offices, the Berlin virologist Christian had recently explained. As a problem, experts see that the annual influenza wave is currently rolling through Germany - and the health system already stressed heavily. For this reason, it is the goal of delaying the spread of the coronavirus as far as possible as the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recently explained. \"We have to try adequate effort to slow the spread to mitigate an intense stress pillar on the health system,\" said Road. \"The number of infections should be extended for a long time as possible.\"\nA value of how many other people infected in a resource is still not given to specify. The virus spreads by droplet infection for about coughing and talking. First results indicate that the virus can also be distributed over the digestive system and at least a few days over surfaces. An underestimated risk was possibly that in stool samples of patients in the initial phase of Covid-19-disease \"quite relevant quantities\" of SARS-COV-2 were detectable, about Clemens Wendtner, chief physician of infectious and tropical medicine at Munich Klinik Schwabing had , explained.\nThat's still a difficult question. For a final assessment of the severity of the new respiratory disease, there are currently not enough data, says something the RKI. According to a recent analysis of Chinese's Health Authority, 2.3 percent die in the country infected with SARS COV-2. Above all, old people and those with severe pre-conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are concerned. For people over the age of 80, the death rate calculated from the data available there is almost 15 percent, so in this age group in China dies about 15 out of 100 infected in China. In the group of 10 to 39 year old people die 0.2 percent of the infected , ie about 2 out of 1000 affected.\nExperts assume that mortality is actually less than calculated in China, among other things, because in Chinese statistics many mild extensive infections are not collected at all. But secured analyzes for mortality from other countries do not exist so far.\nMost people have only a slight cold symptom with freasting and sore throat or no symptoms. Fever, cough and respiratory problems, as they also occur with a flu. Even headaches or diarrhea are possible.\nAccording to the Chinese Health Authority, it comes with more than 80 percent of the infected to mild infection processes, almost 14 percent of suffering difficulty. At almost five percent, life-threatening effects such as respiratory arrest, septic shock or multi-organ failure.\nThe incubation time - the period between infection and start of symptoms - is usually 2 to 14 days after the current level. This is the reason that suspected cases are isolated two weeks.\nThere is no special therapy for the COVID-19 disease. Heavy-patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-lowering agents, the therapy of any bacterial additional infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. In individual cases, antiviral drugs are also tested.\nNo. Several laboratories worldwide are currently researching vaccines as they are available for the flu. The development of a vaccine takes a lot of time. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan believes that first vaccine testing could start people in three to four months. A certified vaccine for far-reaching use is probably only available in 18 months.\nThe US biotech company Moderna had reported on Monday, developed a vaccine candidate and delivered to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NiaID). Its director Anthony Fauci announced according to CNN's first clinical trials for the end of April. He, too, expected it to take one to one and a half years before a vaccine is available.\nTo protect against this as well as other viruses, experts recommend ordinary hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectant and distance to suffice. The benefits of normal breathing masks - as currently in China and other countries to see on the streets - appreciate experts as rather low. It can help to restrict hugs and shaking hands and suggested by many people, such as door tinkers, handles and elevator buttons do not touch.\nBasically, it is unclear how long the virus survives on surfaces, the World Health Organization WHO says. Studies suggested that there are a few hours or days - depending on conditions such as surface, temperature or moisture. The likelihood that an infected goods contaminated with the virus is classified by the authority as low. The risk that a recipient is indicated by a packet exposed on the transport of different conditions and temperatures is low.\nImported foods and goods such as toys, computers or clothes are also unlikely as infection sources, says the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Experts emphasize how important it is to observe general hygiene rules, so about washing their hands regularly.\nIf you had contact to an infected, according to RKI, you should first report to his health department, regardless of whether symptoms have occurred or not. Travelers from risk areas that have symptoms should consult a doctor after telephone reservation with reference to the journey.\nThe essential regulates the nationwide valid Infection Protection Act (IFSG). A spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health summarizes: \"If necessary, important fundamental rights such as freedom of the person, assembly freedom or inviolability of the apartment as well as the right to physical integrity can be restricted.\" Authorities may, according to the Bayreuth State Legal Property Stephan Rixen Blood Assumptions and Scrolls of Skin and mucous membranes demand. Even \"disease suspects\" and \"infectual suspect\" - as the law expresses it - could be imposed on a professional ban. To protect others, people could also \"be separated in a suitable hospital or otherwise suitably\", it says in the law. "}, {"content": "There are no marriages or funerals.

Of 5,000 people evaluated for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 21.5% had obvious symptoms.\nThe hashtag #howtodealwithfeelingveryanxiousathome has been trending on social media platform Weibo, with more than 170 million views, as misinformation about the spread of the disease and travel bans feed public worries.\nThe hotlines are part of the government\u2019s \u201cfirst level response\u201d for dealing with the psychological impact of major health emergencies, a strategy that was first deployed following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a disaster in which 87,150 people were killed or listed as missing.\nThe National Health Commission said more than 300 hotlines had launched across the country to provide mental health advice related to coronavirus, with support from university psychology departments, counseling services and NGOs.\nThey have been inundated by callers in a country which has just 2.2 psychiatrists available for every 100,000 people, according to WHO data, five times fewer than in the United States.\nA national hotline run by Beijing Normal University was overwhelmed when it went live at the end of January, said Cheng Qi, a Shanghai-based psychologist.\nWhile the number of calls has dropped as other lines opens, the content has become more challenging, Cheng said, noting one caller with chronic depression who had reported suicidal thoughts triggered by the barrage of bad news.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the virus [that caused it], but the virus is stimulating it,\u201d she said.\nXu Wang, a psychotherapist at Tsinghua University, which is working with the official Beijing city hotline, said a major challenge was working out which callers showed real symptoms of the virus and which were instead suffering from anxiety.\n\u201cCallers often have somatic issues, and might say, \u2018I can\u2019t eat well, can\u2019t sleep well, and I want to know if it\u2019s a virus infection,\u2019\u201d he said.\nA volunteer group of more than 400 therapists called \u2018Yong Xin Kang Yi\u2019, which roughly translates to \u2018Use Heart to Fight the Virus\u2019, focuses on helping overworked medical staff in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.\n\u201cThey leave messages saying they\u2019re exhausted, that they\u2019re scared,\u201d Cui said. \u201cThe doctors don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to get infected or if their co-workers or going to get infected, and they don\u2019t know how bad it\u2019s spreading.\u201d\nMedical researchers from Peking University included telephone and internet counseling for healthcare staff, patients, and the public among six key strategies for coping with mental stress over the coronavirus outbreak.\n\u201cWe believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate\n2019-nCoV,\u201d the researchers said in a paper published in The Lancet medical journal last week.\nThe government recently issued guidance for the hotlines, saying they should be free, confidential, staffed by volunteers with relevant professional backgrounds and supervised by experienced by experts.\nStill, concerns remain about enforcement.\n\u201cThere are many individually initiated helplines and it\u2019s difficult to gain consistent support and supervision,\u201d said Sami Wong, a Beijing-based psychotherapist.\nTsinghua University\u2019s Xu said the very nature of the hotlines added to the challenges, preventing volunteers from gaining much-needed face-to-face experience with people suffering mental health issues.\nWong worried that untrained volunteers could easily put their foot in their mouth. A seemingly innocuous \u201cI can understand how you feel\u201d can cause vulnerable people to clam up, she said: \u201cPTSD training is not something you can learn overnight.\u201d\n(This story corrects transliteration of names in paragraphs 3, 15 and 16) "}, {"content": "Brussels asks Facebook and Twitter to fight 'Fake News' about Covid-19.

The border between information and alarmism, or in health issues is very dim and the appearance of a new coronavirus in China has put the media again to the test. The debate among the readers of the country jumped since the first news was published three weeks ago. Since then, almost every day there is someone who criticizes the newspaper because he believes that he exaggerates the problem. Others think otherwise. The controversy does not eagerly despite the fact that the newspaper himself has publicly called caution and the measuring.\nThe problem of the new virus was identified on December 16 at a Wuhan Hospital (China), but Beijing did not inform the World Health Organization (WHO) until December 31. Ten days later, the country published on the web the first information with this headline: a virus similar to SARS, responsible for the mysterious pneumonia in China.\nIn the text it was indicated that there were 59 people infected, but no death. The comparison with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which caused 774 deaths in 2002 and 2003, caused the first criticism. This commented on a reader on the web: \"Come, to alarm. 59 affected by a pneumonia at most, zero dead \". Another answered him: \"It is for alarming. If the virus comes from an animal (as it is believed), there is a serious public health problem that can cause an epidemic. \"\nIt was the beginning of a debate that shot when the newspaper began publishing the issue in its printed edition as of January 17. The owner on page 26 of that day was: WHO monitors the progress of the virus discovered in China and detected in two other countries. By then, the disease had charged a deadly victim. And two more on the 20th, when the heading on the web was this: The mortal Wuhan virus expands by China. Reader Pedro Bra\u00f1as told me by mail that he seemed \"unacceptably alarmist\". \"I do not think of a responsible headline for a serious newspaper.\"\nSeven days later, the infected were already 4,400 in a score of countries - the majority in China, but the infection had already arrived in Europe - and the death number exceeded the hundred. Even so, some readers maintained critical positions such as: \"This strange virus has all means of communication by putting the population on emotional alert as if it were the epidemic of the end of the world\"; \"Alarmism, you have to sell\"; \"This punctual retransmission of each case only serves to transmit paranoia and alarmism.\"\nSeveral readers wonder why the newspaper narrates this infection and not the serious effects of influenza. In the 2018-2019 season, recalls c.f., the flu cost the life in Spain to 6,300 people.\nOriol G\u00fcell, a health specialist and signer of several information about the Coronavirus, argues that the newspaper is covered with amplitude, but also with prudence, \"an information of great scientific and medical relevance and, therefore , Undoubted interest to readers \". Between 20 and 27, two news about the Coronavirus were among the ten most read about the newspaper and 30 was the most often when the WHO declared the international alert. \"We do not know the magnitude that this epidemic will have and report its evolution day by day is an inescapable obligation of the media,\" says G\u00fcell. He adds that the common flu (such as tobacco, traffic or suicides) causes thousands of deaths a year, but \"are already known phenomena,\" while the Wuhan Coronavirus \"is something new to still unpredictable consequences.\"\nTo justify such coverage (half hundred texts in 15 days), G\u00fcell recalls that the magnitudes of this infection have no precedents: 10,000 infected in 25 countries (Spain included) and more than 200 killed in a month, confinement of 56 million people In 13 Chinese cities, global stock impacts, prevention measures in thousands of airplanes and airports, repatriations of foreigners ...\nObjective data Support that the behavior of the newspaper has not been excessive. The country only addressed the issue when there was evidence of the severity of the case: on January 9 on the web and 17, on paper. Until 21, no call on first page appeared and on 24 was, for the first time, the main news with an informative, not alarmist holder: China isolates 21 million people to stop the expansion of the virus.\nEven the newspaper published an editorial on day 29 entitled weight, in which he said: \"You have to maintain an attentive surveillance, but without falling into alarmisms that can aggravate the consubstantial damage to an epidemic of this nature.\"\nAs the Economist pointed out, \"the world is better prepared than ever to stop the Wuhan Coronavirus.\" Thus, because governments - Chinese, the first - and health authorities have learned from serious mistakes of the past.

"}, {"content": "Economist who counted $54.5 billion Sars cost sees bigger hit from Wuhan virus. SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - The global cost of the coronavirus could be three or four times that of the 2003 Sars outbreak that sapped the world's economy by US$40 billion (S$54.5 billion), according to the economist who calculated that figure. \n The sheer growth in the Chinese economy over the last 17 years means the global health emergency triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, has far greater potential to gouge global growth, according to Warwick McKibbin, professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra. \n \"It's just a mathematical thing,\" McKibbin said in a phone interview. \"Most of the GDP loss that we saw in the Sars model, and in reality, was China slowing down. And so, with China much bigger, you'd expect the billions would be much bigger.\" \n While difficult to pinpoint a precise cost as the crisis is still unfolding, the impact will be experienced mostly through changes in \"human psychology,\" he said. \"Panic is what seems to be the biggest drain on the economy, rather than deaths.\" \n Markets have been whipsawed by panic, Paris-based Amundi Asset Management said in a Jan 29 note. Chief investment officer Pascal Blanque and his deputy Vincent Mortier said the novel coronavirus provided the trigger for a pause in a stock market rally that began in October. \n McKibbin's forecasts are in line with those of other analysts. \n Nomura International expects the blow to China's growth could exceed that seen during the Sars outbreak. Real GDP growth in the first quarter could \"materially drop\" from the 6 per cent pace in the fourth quarter, maybe by even more than the 2 percentage point deceleration seen in the second quarter of 2003 from the first, Nomura economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a report to clients. \n Bloomberg economists Chang Shu, Jamie Rush and Tom Orlik, said: \"Back in 2003, China accounted for just 4 per cent of global GDP. Fast forward to 2020, and its share has increased to 17 per cent. That means the global spillover if China's growth slumps will be larger. \n \"Hong Kong stands out as the most exposed - our simulation shows a hit of 1.7 percentage points (ppt) in the first quarter. South Korea and Vietnam would also suffer, each slowing by 0.4 ppt. Japan would take a 0.2 ppt hit.\" \n More contagious than Sars but less deadly, the insidious nature of the coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, is such that it often presents as mild cold-like symptoms and can go undetected, which could potentially protract out the crisis for longer than the 2003 epidemic. \n The new virus, which emerged in central China in late 2019, is reported to have infected almost 10,000 people in two months, eclipsing the 8,096 Sars cases reported from November 2002 through 2003, when the contagion spread from China across South-east Asia and to North America and Europe. \n \"If a country had a bad epidemiological outcome, then their shocks were likely be a lot bigger than countries that were able to control it well,\" McKibbin said, referring to his findings from examining the impact of Sars.

WASHINGTON - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week as employers continued to hold on to their workers, but the coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to an increase in layoffs as companies battle supply chain disruptions and sagging demand for some goods and services.  \n Some businesses are already cutting jobs and demand is weakening, at least at the factory level. Other reports on Thursday showed companies announced more than 600 layoffs through March 12 tied to the outbreak, while producer prices fell by the most in five years in February as prices for energy products and services such as hotel accommodation, shipping and air travel dropped.  \n Financial markets are expecting the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates again at its policy meeting next week to counter the coronavirus, which investors fear is the catalyst that will derail the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.  \n \"It's just a matter of time before the fallout from the coronavirus starts to show up in increased layoff activity,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.  \n Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended March 7, the Labor Department said. Jobless claims are the most timely labor market indicator. They have declined for two straight weeks.  \n Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 218,000 in the latest week.  \n The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,250 to 214,000 last week.  \n Unadjusted claims for Washington state, hardest hit by the virus, which causes a respiratory disease called COVID-19, rose modestly last week.  \n The World Health Organization on Wednesday termed the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The virus with flu-like symptoms has killed at least 38 people in the United States and sickened more than 1,300. Overall, more than 4,700 people have died from COVID-19 and over 127,000 have been infected.  \n The Fed last week slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, in its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis. Financial markets have fully priced in a rate reduction of as much as 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's March 17-18 policy meeting.  \n Economists are predicting the Fed will reduce its benchmark overnight interest rate to zero by year-end, given low inflation expectations, underscored by a plunge in Treasury yields.  \n The dollar jumped against a basket of currencies after the European Central Bank announced more stimulus to fight the coronavirus but did not lower rates. Stocks on Wall Street continued to drop, with the Dow Jones Industrials index on course for its worst day since 1987 as investors took a dim view of President Donald Trump's decision to suspend travel from Europe. U.S. Treasury prices rose.  \n  \n WEAK PRODUCER PRICES  \n The disease originated in China , the main source of inputs used in factories, as well as goods consumed in the United States. While some Chinese factories have resumed operations after Beijing extended the Lunar New Year holidays in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, they are running below capacity. The coronavirus is hurting demand for transportation, especially air travel, as well as entertainment and recreation, and leisure and hospitality services.  \n Companies in the energy sector have also been affected as crude prices have tumbled, a decline that has been exacerbated by an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The United States is now a net exporter of oil and weak crude prices are likely to hurt capital expenditure and employment in the sector.  \n A separate report on Thursday from global placement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas showed as of the morning of March 12, employers had laid off 633 workers. Most of the job cuts were in the entertainment and leisure industry. Transportation, technology and energy sectors were not spared.  \n The trend could persist, with a third report from the Labor Department showing the producer price index for final demand dropped 0.6% last month, the biggest decline since January 2015, after surging 0.5% in January. In the 12 months through February, the PPI increased 1.3% after gaining 2.1% in January.  \n Economists had forecast the PPI dipping 0.1% in February and rising 1.8% on a year-on-year basis. While the coronavirus-driven bottlenecks in the supply chain could boost prices for inputs, that is likely to be offset by weak oil prices and falling demand for services.  \n In February, wholesale gasoline prices plummeted 6.5% after declining 1.5% in January. Gasoline accounted for nearly one-third of the 0.9% drop in the cost of goods last month. The decline in goods was the most since September 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in January. Wholesale food prices fell 1.6%.  \n The cost of services dropped 0.3% in February after rebounding 0.7% in January.  \n There were decreases in the cost of airline tickets, water transportation of freight and hotel accommodation, which recorded its biggest decline since April 2009.  \n But the cost of healthcare services rose 0.2% last month after rising 0.6% in January. Portfolio management fees increased 0.3% after accelerating 2.3% in January. They could, however, take a hit from an ongoing sharp sell-off on Wall Street. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.  \n \"There are early signs in PPI that the coronavirus will weigh on various consumer prices significantly in coming months,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup in New York.

LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (here) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to speak of a pandemic.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with \u201ccrown\u201d-like spikes.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a \u201crecombinant\u201d virus strain.

SINGAPORE \u2014 While it took four months before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) was fully eradicated from Singapore back in 2003, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \n However, Mr Lee stressed that \u201clife has to go on\u201d and Singaporeans have to continue making a living. \n Speaking to reporters on Friday (Feb 14) after meeting various frontline staff members at Changi Airport, Mr Lee said: \u201cSars took us from March when we had our first cases, until July before we were declared clear and that was, I think very fast. I expect it not to be so fast this time.\u201d \n As China\u2019s economy is bigger and more interlinked with Singapore and the region\u00a0compared to the situation in 2003 then, Mr Lee said that the economic impact of the outbreak would be significant as it is a \u201cvery intense outbreak\u201d.\u00a0 \n He added that a recession was \u201cpossible\u201d and the economic impact on Singapore so far is already believed to be much more than Sars.\u00a0 \n Speaking to several frontline staff at Changi Airport, including airline crew and sales personnel at the retail stores, he said that the airport had been \u201csubstantially impacted\u201d. \n \u201cThe flights are down by a third, the shops here are hard hit, and at the same time the crews have to keep the airport running and stay at their posts and keep Singapore open for business\u201d, he said. \n He said that new developments were happening every day and the Government is making a judgement on what is the right thing to do at each point.\u00a0 \n \u201cSo we have to calibrate and judge as we go on each step, what is the most prudent thing to do. Err on the side of caution, but make a sensible judgment.

Don't just act on a knee jerk, based on somebody's headline,\u2019\u201d said Mr Lee. \n When asked about more clusters emerging, PM Lee said that this does not yet constitute widespread community transmission as most of these cases are still traceable to a particular source. \n \u201cSo we will have to watch the trend,\u00a0 how the trend goes, whether the numbers go up and also whether the cases are traceable and we can continue to do contact tracing and then squeeze out the clusters one by one,\u201d he said. \n During Mr Lee\u2019s visit at Changi Airport, he also met taxi drivers who were willing to ferry healthcare workers and gave them a care package consisting of hand sanitisers and disinfectant wipes.\u00a0 \n Separately on Friday, he also penned a Valentine\u2019s Day note to all healthcare workers on the frontline.\u00a0 \n Posting a photo of his handwritten card on Facebook, he thanked them for looking after patients \u201cday after day\u201d. \n \"Your loving care and commitment makes all the difference.

Given the scale of the challenge and the danger to human lives the WHO has described the pandemic as the \"defining global health crisis of our time\" -- the efforts of Indian government under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been applauded widely. Henk Bekedam, the WHO Representative to India, was quoted as saying that the \"commitment of the Indian government from the top level has been enormous, and very impressive\".\nAt the very first level -- unlike China, which long remained in denial mode -- the Indian government was quick enough to activate its health management system and issue necessary travel advisories. Many state governments followed suit, leading to the early detection and isolation of infected patients.\nMoreover, the state machinery -- led by the Ministry of Health and other related agencies -- were prompt enough to issue 'valid precautionary guidelines' to keep the public well-informed and prepared.\nThe monitoring of the coronavirus outbreak at the PMO level has backed this process. Well-coordinated action plans include careful airport checking, active health laboratories and the quick establishment of quarantine facilities across the country. The strategy of the government has been to stick to the prevention is better than cure\u2019 model.\nMore importantly, the Indian government has also been applauded globally for safely flying back many of its citizens -- especially workers and students stuck abroad in the mainland China and other coronavirus-affected countries, speaking volumes about the government\u2019s concern and efforts for its citizens.\nIn addition, Indian efforts have remained completely aligned to guidelines from the WHO, which has been monitoring the crisis since it began and advocating the aggressive testing, tracking and isolation of as many Covid-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) cases as possible.\nTo sum it up, managing a new virus outbreak is never a easy task for any state, but the way the Indian emergency response system has been activated holds lessons for the other countries in the future.\nAbhishek Pratap Singh has a PhD in China Studies from JNU and teaches at the Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi.

The Japan Times quoted Health Minister\u00a0Katsunobu Kato as saying that the patient who died was a woman in her 80s who hailed\u00a0from Kanagawa region in the southwest of Tokyo.Japan has 33 cases of domestic infection; however, some 218 people on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been docked at the port in Yokohama since early February,\u00a0have also been tested positive for COVID-19.Besides China and Japan,\u00a0others\u00a0in the top 10 countries with the highest number of infections are Singapore\u00a058 cases, Thailand 33, South Korea 28, Malaysia 19, Germany\u00a016, Vietnam 16, Australia 15, United States 15 and France 11.\u00a0Yesterday, AFP reported that several villages in Vietnam with about 10,000 people situated close to the nation's capital were placed under quarantine yesterday\u00a0after six cases of COVID-19 were discovered there.On Feb 11, media reports from Wuhan stated that new research based on data gathered from more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients in China found that the incubation period for the virus was as long as 24 days rather than the previously believed 14 days.The study, carried out by about 36 researchers from Chinese hospitals and medical schools, found that less than half of the patients showed fever symptoms when they first saw a doctor.Head of the research team Dr Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese epidemiologist who discovered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, was quoted as saying that much is still unknown about COVID-19.Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and breathing difficulty. In more severe cases, the infection can lead to lung inflammation, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\u00a0COVID-19 BACKGROUNDAccording to the WHO website, its China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia that were detected in Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019.\u00a0On Jan 7, the Chinese authorities confirmed that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted from human to human.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV).A study of the virus' genetic sequence suggested similarities to that seen in snakes and bats.China health officials identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as the source of the transmission of the coronavirus.Besides Malaysia, COVID-19 has spread to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, Germany, United States, France, Macau, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom,\u00a0Canada, Italy, Russia, Spain, Finland, Cambodia, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Belgium.On Jan 30, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global emergency. By then, it had spread to 18 countries and caused 170 deaths.The declaration was aimed at preventing or reducing transmissions across borders.With 1,489 deaths worldwide as of today, COVID-19 has overtaken SARS which caused 774 deaths in 2003.\u00a0Translated by Rema NambiarBERNAMA "}, {"content": "China reports new virus cases, raising concern globally before key holiday.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading COVID-19 without knowing they are sick.\nAs the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. The border of Hubei province, epicenter of the virus, opened on Wednesday after a two-month shutdown.\nBut there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation.\nAsymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious disease, making it harder to detect and stop transmission.\nIn China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000.\nChina had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday.\nAsymptomatic cases are currently found through \u201ccontact tracing\u201d. China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms.\n\u201cAsymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,\u201d said Wu Zunyou of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. \u201cSo will they be able to create transmission? They won\u2019t.\u201d\nStill, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing\u2019s commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control.\nDespite recording zero new infections from March 18 to March 22, the COVID-19 hotspot city of Wuhan disclosed on March 20 that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year old man surnamed Zhang had shown no symptoms.\nCiting hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient.\nChina says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage.     But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined.\nSome experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased.\n\u201cIt is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney.\nIt is also unclear how much they might infect others.\n\u201cWe know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that\u2019s a major driver of transmission,\u201d said Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization at a briefing early in March.\nNew studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan.\nWhile many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill.\nAnother study published on March 23, looking at cases in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18% of patients were asymptomatic. Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest.\nThe Yale School of Public Health said the existence of presymptomatic (asymptomatic) patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries.\n\u201cThe real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\u201d said Ian Henderson, Director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University.

SINGAPORE \u2014 With Singapore\u2019s blood banks closely watching the screening of donors during the coronavirus outbreak, the authorities are appealing for healthy donors to give blood because stocks have dipped to low or critical levels. \n In response to TODAY\u2019s enquiries on Friday (Feb 14), the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), which manages Singapore\u2019s blood banks, said: \u201cOur blood stocks are currently trending downwards. We, therefore, strongly urge donors who are healthy and eligible to step forward as our patients really need your support during this challenging period.\u201d \n With extra precautions in place, such as stringent screening of donors before they are allowed into the blood banks, HSA said that the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, while giving blood is assessed to be low. \n The Singapore Red Cross said on its website that on Friday, stocks for the A+, B+, O+ and AB+ blood types were at \u201ccritical\u201d levels, and those for the A-, B-, O- and AB- blood types were \u201clow\u201d. \n When blood stocks are at the critical level, this means that donors are urgently needed and urged to donate on the same day. \n For blood types where stocks are low, donors are urged to donate within the week. \n HSA said that blood is needed every day to support the needs of patients in Singapore, and that it was important to maintain at least six days of blood stock at all times for daily transfusion needs and bleeding emergencies. \n Last year, there were 75,655 blood donors, or just 1.87 per cent of the resident population. \n NO EVIDENCE CORONAVIRUS CAN SPREAD THROUGH BLOOD \n For now, there is no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted through blood, HSA said. \n Even so, the authority has put in place a slew of measures to ensure the safety of the blood supply and the health of its donors. \n Since last Friday \u2014 when Singapore raised its disease outbreak response code to Orange \u2014 HSA has been screening potential donors and their companions for fever or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or runny nose, and their travels to mainland China, before they can enter the blood banks or mobile donation drives.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Those who are unwell, on leave of absence or have been to China in the last 14 days will be barred entry. \n Apart from beefing up the screening of donors, HSA said that staff members were monitoring their temperatures twice daily, and have been told to wear masks and see a doctor if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. \n \u201cTo further assure our donors, we have also increased the frequency of cleaning to ensure the cleanliness standards of our blood banks,\u201d HSA added. \n INFECTED DONORS TO BE DEFERRED \n As for donors who have Covid-19 infection, their donations will be deferred until more information becomes available, HSA said. \n \u201cThey will only be allowed to donate blood when there is more medical data to indicate when it is safe for donors who have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection to donate blood again,\u201d it added. \n Blood donors told TODAY that they would continue to give blood, although one donor is concerned about visiting the blood banks. \n Undergraduate Tan Hui Lin, 24, who last donated blood in 2018, said that the blood banks are in areas where people tend to congregate. \n HSA\u2019s four blood banks are in Outram, Dhoby Ghaut, Woodlands and Jurong East. \n \u201cMost of us would avoid crowded places\u2026 there\u2019s high inertia to actually leave the house,\u201d Ms Tan said, although she added that she would donate blood if the supply is low. \n Mr Shahroull Khairoullah, 29, a painting company owner who gives blood every three months, said that he would not do so for now because he has been coughing for the past few weeks. \n Business development manager Chan Si Yong, 27, said that HSA\u2019s added precautions were helpful, even though screening procedures were already stringent before the virus outbreak. \n Donors have to fill in a health questionnaire and be checked by a medical screener, he said. \u201cIf you are unwell, they will turn you down.\u201d \n Public servant Andrew Wilfred, 33, said that the coronavirus outbreak would not deter him from donating blood. \n \u201cI trust that the nurses are doing their best to maintain the high standards of hygiene that they have always done.\u201d \n For information on where to go for blood donation and the blood banks' opening hours, go to HSA's website\u00a0or the Singapore Red Cross' website.

SINGAPORE \u2014 A person\u2019s physical and mental health get messed up on a regular basis when he or she travels frequently for work, and the latest coronavirus epidemic is not helping matters presently. \n Mental health issues are predicted to be one of the top 10 risks that business travellers will face this year. This is based on the latest Travel Risks Outlook 2020 report by global travel risk management company International SOS. \n Yet, these issues remain an overlooked aspect of business travel, especially in today\u2019s hypermobile work climate. \n Dr Low Kiang Wei, medical director of International SOS, said that not only does business travel take a toll on physical health, it also affects individuals on a psychological level due to factors such as time spent apart from loved ones, blurred lines between work and after-work hours, and anxiety due to unexpected increases in workload. \n Navigating travel risks such as natural disasters or epidemics can add on to the stress. \n Infectious diseases outbreaks are also one of the risks highlighted in International SOS\u2019 report. \n So far, health officials in China have confirmed more than 31,000 cases of the new coronavirus, with more than 4,800 of them considered severe. The disease, which causes pneumonia in its severe form, has claimed the lives of more than 630 people in China. \n The virus, also known as 2019-nCov, has also sickened more than 200 people in at least 20 countries. In Singapore, two patients who are warded are under intensive care. \n Dr Low said of the anxiety that travellers face: \u201cWithout appropriate pre-trip awareness, risk mitigation advice, access to 24/7 assistance in case of emergencies such as natural disasters or epidemics, business travellers can also feel unnecessarily stressed about their own safety.\u201d \n Even with the appropriate preparations, an evolving and escalating situation such as the current coronavirus epidemic can considerably increase a traveller\u2019s stress, he added. \n \u201cThere is an element of the unknown and situations can change quickly. \n \u201cIn these circumstances, it is important to provide access to timely, accurate, verified information.

It looks like a world war against a virus. The novel coronavirus which has acquired pandemic scale both in its spread and declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Now, for the first time, the rest of the world has more coronavirus cases than China, the source region.\nThe total number of Covid-19 patients in the world has crossed 1.67 lakh with China accounting for less than 82,000, according to WHO's latest report. While the world reported 13,903 cases in preceding 24 hours. Only 29 of these were reported from China.\nThe WHO has already declared Europe as the new epicentre of coronavirus pandemic. Incidentally, it was only after the theatre of pandemic shifted from oriental landscape to Europe that the more dominant powers appeared serious in tackling the contagion. Here is an account of how the world has dealt with coronavirus pandemic.\nINSULATION\nThe United States has suspended all flights from Europe. President Donald Trump is expected to declare national emergency. Many European countries such as Germany, France and Britain have followed a similar strategy to insulate themselves. This method has worked for many less developed countries such as Magnolia, which is surrounded by China from three sides, North Korea, located like cheese between the slices of South Korea and China, two of the worst affected countries in the world.\nIndia too imposed massive travel restrictions. India began screening of passengers coming to India in the final week of February. The vigil was up not only at airports but also at the sea ports. The government said more than 27,000 people were not allowed to land in India at sea ports as the paths of the ships had crossed coronavirus affected countries.\nIn nut shell, country-quantine is the most preferred method adopted by various governments to check spread of Covid-19.\nCovid-19 is a pandemic both in its scale of spread and by the declaration of the WHO. However, it is peculiar that there has not been attempts by leading countries to devise a common and coordinated strategy to fight the contagion.\nChina called for international cooperation in early February. The WHO too called for a concerted global effort. But all countries ultimately devised their own specific strategy to deal with coronavirus spread.\nWhen the Donald Trump administration suspended flight operations from Europe, the decision was criticised for having been unilateral in nature. Italy, Iran and other worse affected countries felt constrained in dealing with the crisis leading to sudden spike in the cases of Covid-19.\nIndia, however, showed some initiative recently with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosting a video-conference with the leaders of the Saarc. Decision was taken to create a Saarc fund to fight coronavirus spread. Such attempts taken in the initial days might have kept the novel coronavirus in check to a large extent.\nAnother tactic reportedly adopted by some countries was of underreporting and covering up the coronavirus outbreak. It began with China.\nFor first two months -- now the first victims of novel coronavirus have been traced back to November 2019 against previously set starting point of mid-December 2019 -- China refused to acknowledge the Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe doctor who first went public with the reporting of coronavirus outbreak was severely reprimanded by the Chinese government. The first health workers alerting the officials and asking people to beware of this contagion were also reportedly warned for \"rumour mongering\".\nLater , that doctor died. Chinese media said he died of Covid-19. This all happened despite Chinese President Xi Jinping telling the public that anyone found hiding the truth would be severely dealt with. Recently, an old aide of Xi Jinping went missing after he criticised the Chinese government for its handling of coronavirus pandemic.\nA pattern of cover-up was also seen in Italy and Iran, the two worst affected countries outside the source zone in China-Hong Kong-South Korea. Italian authorities are said to have dismissed the reports of coronavirus in initial days. They responded only after the situation spiralled out of control. The health infrastructure was found to be inadequate in the country. Same has been the case with Iran, which has already been reeling under the impact of multiple sanctions.\nIn India, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Modi government was in stupor as coronavirus caused havoc in the country. This was an allegation of cover up. Though, the government has been coming out with daily updates on the matter. The government has said that it is on the top of coronavirus situation in the country.\nCoronavirus pandemic has challenged the human capital of the world. In equal measure if not more is the pressure that the governments are feeling over their economic capital. The full scale economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is still unknowns but economic boosters are already being announced.\nThe US Federal Reserve has cut down the interest rate to zero, and announced a mega $700 billion quantitative easing programme as the economy reels under the coronavirus pressure.\nThe UK has slashed interest rates on loans for small and medium businesses. Germany has announced tax cuts. Australia has announced to pump billions of dollars in its market to avoid coronavirus-induced slowdown.\nItaly announced a $28 billion dollar package to strengthen its health infrastructure. The European Commission followed the similar suit. Iran, for the first time in nealy six decades asked for money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India has decided to infuse Rs 1 lakh crore in the market to fight off adverse impact of coronavirus pandemic on Indian businesses. The RBI has not altered the regular banking duties but asked the customers to do more digital transactions to avoid contact with bank employees and keep less pressure on the banking staff.

The preservation of social stability remains a priority. The criticism was followed by the slowness for the slowness of the initial reaction. The authorities have been extended and relentless in the adoption of energetic and unprecedented measures and this has placed them. At least, for now.\nWithout option to hesitates, the CCP stresses the muscles to demonstrate its invincibility. Far from being amylaved, the slogan aims to go around the crisis, making it a palpable demonstration of its aptitude to face the most serious challenges, whatever they are. A message aimed at both Chinese society and the rest of the world, even in scientific order, with capacity and competence exhibition to find quick answers, at another time perhaps impossible. China can not yet be compared with the West in many parameters, but I would like to be able to have a crisis of these proportions suggest Xi Jinping crisis.

The Epidemic of Coronavirus of Wuhan threatens, increasingly, to become a new element of friction - one more- in the complicated relations between the United States and China. Beijing has made it clear its discomfort over the way Washington has reacted to the greatest catastrophe that the Asian country lives in years. Measures such as the suspension of flights or veto travelers from China only serve, according to the government of President Xi Jinping, to \"create and propagate fear\".\nIt is the second occasion, in just three days, in which Beijing has ceased its irritation so it considers an exaggerated reaction of the first power. This Monday, at a press conference offered through the Internet - as part of the measures to avoid agglomerations and prevent contagion-, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, accused Washington that, in addition to giving the pistolleta of Departure to a worldwide race to close air borders and traffic, \"has not yet offered any substantial aid to the Chinese side.\"\nThe epidemic still is still under control in China.

The cases of contagion outside Hubei, the focus province of the epidemic, also decreased for two days, a possible indication that the drastic measures that the central government has imposed against the propagation of the virus begin to take effect.\nThose \"green outbreaks\" feed Beijing's anger towards how United States has answered, with too much precipitation from his point of view.

The economic impact of the crisis and attention required by Chinese leaders can complicate Beijing to comply with the commitments of strong increases in their imports of agricultural, energy and manufacturing products from US. \"Travel restrictions and closures of Borders at least will lead the logistics to meet those objectives, \"says analyst Michael Hirson, of the consultant Eurasia Group, on a note.\nIf the epidemic motivates a prolonged descent of the yuan price against the dollar - these days has crossed the key border of the seven yuan per dollar - \"Trump can resume his criticisms against China about his exchange rate policy,\" he says Hirson "}, {"content": "China to lift lockdown over Covid-19 epicentres amid warnings of second wave.

SHANGHAI (REUTERS) - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading Covid-19 without knowing they are sick. \n As the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. \n The border of Hubei province, epicentre of the virus, opened on Wednesday (March 25) after a two-month shutdown. \n But there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation. \n Asymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious diseases, making it harder to detect and stop transmission. \n In China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000. \n China had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday. \n Asymptomatic cases are currently found through \"contact tracing\". China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms. \n \"Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,\" said Dr Wu Zunyou of the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. \n \"So will they be able to create transmission? They won't.\" \n Still, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing's commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control. \n Despite recording zero new infections from last Wednesday to Sunday, the Covid-19 hot spot city of Wuhan disclosed last Friday\u00a0that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year-old man surnamed Zhang, had shown no symptoms. \n Citing hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient. \n China says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage. \n But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined. \n Some experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased. \n \"It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,\" said Mr Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney. \n It is also unclear how much they might infect others. \n \"We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that's a major driver of transmission,\" said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organisation at a briefing early in March. \n New studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defence Forces Central Hospital in Japan. \n While many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill. \n Another study published on Monday, looking at cases in the south-western Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18 per cent of patients were asymptomatic. \n Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest. \n The Yale School of Public Health said the existence of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic\u00a0patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries. \n \"The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\" said Dr Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University.

Wuhan will not let people leave the city until April 8.\nSome people at the railway station, such as a woman who only gave her surname as Zhang, said they were there to see if there was any chance people could leave earlier.\nHer grandson came to visit her for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in January and has been separated from his parents in the southern city of Shenzhen ever since.

But the evolution of the epidemic was substantially more gradual.\nWhat is more: Little by little, scientific teams were distinguishing the actual added impact of the virus, imposing parallel the necessary containment and response measures. In the end, it was a contagious disease, yes, and surprisingly dangerous for the younger ones (when the flu usually affects especially those over 65). But did not suppose the catastrophe in mortality that our minds wanted to dramatize: According to an estimate of the US Disease Control Center, H1N1 ended with the lives of approximately the same people than seasonal flu, remaining below other pandemics in last.\nOur brain, however, remains determined to look for dramas so be in seemingly cold numbers. One of these figures, which has captured the attention of the audience in social networks over the NECO, is the one known as R0: the average of people who will be infected from another already infected by a disease. We barely had a few weeks of epidemic when several epidemiologists took out their estimates.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus epidemic has closed the first of 16 specially built hospitals, hurriedly put up to treat people with the virus, after it discharged its last recovered patients, state broadcaster CCTV said on Monday.\nNews of the closure coincided with a sharp fall in new cases in Hubei province and its capital of Wuhan but China remained on alert for people returning home with the virus from other countries where it has spread.\n\u201cThe rapid rising trend of virus cases in Wuhan has been controlled,\u201d Mi Feng, a spokesman for China\u2019s National Health Commission told a briefing.\n\u201cOutbreaks in Hubei outside of Wuhan are curbed and provinces outside of Hubei are showing a positive trend.\u201d\nThe virus emerged in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, the majority in China, with most in Hubei.\nOutside China, it has in recent days spread rapidly, now to 53 countries, with more than 6,500 cases and more than 100 deaths. In all, the illness has killed nearly 3,000 people.\nHubei on Sunday reported 196 new infections, the first time since January it has reported fewer than 200 in a day, the National Health Commission said on Monday.\nAfter what some critics said was an initially hesitant response to the new virus, China imposed sweeping restrictions to try to stop it, including widespread suspensions of transport and extending a Lunar New Year holiday across the country.\nMi said authorities would transition from \u201coverall containment to targeted containment\u201d measures, with a focus on containment within communities, and medical treatment.\nWuhan\u2019s Communist Party chief Chen Yixin hailed the government\u2019s virus prevention efforts and said he expected the number of new cases to soon drop below 100 a day, the Communist Party\u2019s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said.\n\u201cThe outbreak situation is under strong control,\u201d Chen said of the situation in the city.\nMainland China had a total of 202 new confirmed cases on Sunday, the lowest since Jan. 22. All but six were in Hubei.\nThe death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 2,912 as of the end of Sunday, up by 42 from the previous day.\nHubei accounted for all of the 42 new deaths, with 32 of them in Wuhan.\nWith numbers of new infections falling, Wuhan closed its first specially built hospital after it discharged the last batch of 34 recovered patients, CCTV reported.\nWuhan opened 16 temporary hospitals, adding 13,000 beds and treating 12,000 people in response to the outbreak.\nEighteen provinces across China have lowered their coronavirus emergency response level in the past week, the latest being Zhejiang province.\nThere are also growing signs of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy getting back to business after a crippling February that saw factory activity contract sharply.\nThe economy and information technology bureau in the commercial hub of Shanghai said that 66% of its businesses had resumed operations, though only 53% of small enterprises were back to work, underscoring lingering difficulties for private businesses.\nChinese shares soared on hopes the government would roll out more measures to support the economy. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC adding 3.2% on Monday, its best day since March 2019.\nBut as the country slowly returns to normal, President Xi Jinping has warned that China needed to take a long-term view of the outbreak and plug loopholes in emergency response mechanisms.\nThe case of an infected inmate released from a Wuhan prison, who then traveled to Beijing, had in particular prompted sharp criticism over loopholes.\nOn Monday, a government investigation team sent to Wuhan called the former inmate\u2019s return to Beijing a \u201cserious incident caused by dereliction of duty\u201d, CCTV reported.\nIn an illustration of the dangers of what has evolved into a global epidemic, Beijing reported two new coronavirus cases in Chinese nationals who recently returned from Iran, where the outbreak has grown quickly.\nThe Global Times newspaper also reported on Monday an imported case, from someone returning from Italy, which has become Europe\u2019s coronavirus hot spot. "}, {"content": "The Coronavirus also threatens the economy in China. Inactivity and uncertainty give China these days a strange air sleepwalker. Just circulate vehicles or walk people through the streets. More than 46 million people are blocked by quarantine. Many transport, suspended. Classes in teaching centers, canceled to new order. The shops, closed. The Coronavirus of Wuhan, who has already killed 170 people and infected with more than 7,800, threatens to leave, at least in the short term, profound effects on the country's economy, which already faced its lower growth in decades, 6.1 %.\nAccording to the economist Zhang Ming, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - the main Chinese state Think Tank -, in statements that collects the magazine Caijing, GDP growth in the first quarter of this year could be reduced at a percentage point and Situated at 5% or even less, due to the parion because of the virus.\nThese days, Chinese cities look like huge deserts. Cinemas, museums, and tourist attractions have canceled their operations. Most stores continue to closed; Those who have opened -with the dependents well covered by a mask - barely register activity, except those that sell groceries. Many restaurants have not bothered to reopen despite the fact that, under normal conditions, these would be days of making a box: now the public avoids the crowded places. In the industrial nucleus of Suzhou, factories are prohibited from reopening until February 8. In Shanghai, companies will not resume their activity at least until 9.\nAlong with consumption, the sector most affected by containment measures has been transportation. To the blockade of a good part of Hubei, the province where Wuhan is located - the focus of the infection - adds the recommendation to avoid displacements as much as possible. The airports, where it should be his time with greater activity of the year, are half-life. We have paralyzed long-distance bus routes and high speed train. Travel abroad with tour operators have been suspended. According to official government data, transportation has fallen with respect to lunar New Year dates from 2019 by 28.8%. In the railway sector, the descent reaches 41.5%. In the aerial, 41.6%.\nThe situation could not reach worse. The Chinese New Year is, like Christmas or Black Friday in the West, the moment of greater spending on consumption, a sector of increasing weight in Chinese GDP. A weak demand and the shocks caused by the commercial war between the United States and China had left economic growth at 6.1%, its lowest level in three decades.\n\"The impact of Coronavirus in the Chinese economy can be much more important than the SARS - explains Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, Chief Economist for Asia from the Natixis Investment Bank. Garc\u00eda-Herrero alludes to the syndrome that, also caused by a coronavirus of the same family as Wuhan , it emerged in 2003 in a canton market (southern China) to leave almost 800 fatalities around the world.\nThen, that epidemic subtracted a percentage point to Chinese growth during the second quarter of the year, which stood at 9.1%. Retail sales fell halfway. Although the blow to the economy was only temporary, and in later quarters the growth recovered its previous levels above 10%.\nBut now, Garc\u00eda-Herrero points out, \"China depends much more on the consumption of what depended in 2003, and consumption will be decelerated without any doubt.\" To luxury and durable goods you have to add the hospitality sector. \"There are many sectors that are going to be affected, and that they are much more important for Chinese growth than they were in 2003, when the external demand was the key,\" he says.\n\"In China during 2019, consumption contributed close to 3.5 percentage points to total total growth of 6.1% of GDP. A quick calculation points to whether spending on those services falling by 10%, the total GDP growth would fall by about 1.2 percentage points, \"says the consultancy S & P Global Ratings on a note.\nThe first indications are not encouraging. In its reopening after the holidays, the shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have receded 2.4%. Due to the closure of the main chains and the suspension of the major premieres, in New Year, when box office records are usually broken, the collection in theaters was only 1.81 million yuan, or about 250,000 euros, according to the company Ticket sales Maousan. It is a fall of 99% with respect to the previous year.\n\"It is a certainty that the croconavirus outbreak will have an impact on this quarter's economic growth,\" says Mark Williams, capital Economics, on a note. Compared to SARS, \"while this time the most transparent and active official response can be demonstrated more effectively in virus containment, it can also make the initial economic damage.\"\nA good part of these damages could correspond to the broad sector of the Chinese submerged economy, the one represented by migrants to urban areas. Back in the field to pass the festivities with their relatives, many have been surprised by the quarantine or have seen their travel plans altered. The prolonged paron of his jobs can leave them without income while it lasts.\n\"After SARS, China adopted an expansive fiscal policy, including tax cuts, to help the recovery of the most affected sectors,\" says Tianlei Huang, from the International Institute of Economics Peterson (PIIE). \"This time, China has large fiscal deficits and, therefore, has less space to apply fiscal stimuli than then. In monetary policy, the central bank can increase liquidity support, but there will be no stimulus driven by credit. \"\nThe key, analysts point, will be rapidly with which the crisis is resolved. \"Depending on how the crisis is reduced, and especially how the Chinese Government is managed - not for a short extent as transparent to be-, the cost could aggravate the reduction of Chinese growth,\" says Huang.

This Friday, the Spanish Ministry of Health discarded two other potential contagions and the United States detected the existence of a second affected by the disease, which has already caused 41 dead in China, according to the last figures updated by Bloomberg, and maintains in quarantine to 41 Millions of people in that country.\nBy announcing at first time of the night the first two cases, the French Minister of Health, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, warned that everything points out that these first European cases will not be the only ones. Shortly after, it's office confirmed the third case, related to one of the first two detected. \"It is likely that there are other\" people infected in European territory, overtaking Buzyn, for whom the virus \"is a fire that must be delimited.\"\nIn all the French cases, these are people who have been in China and, at least one of them, is recorded that it was in the city of Wuhan. It is the patient admitted to Bordeaux, a 48-year-old Chinese citizen who came to a medical center on Thursday 23 to \"consult by the symptoms\" presented after his return one day before China, where \"he passed through the city of Wuhan\" For \"Professional Reasons,\" Buzyn explained at a press conference. The affected one is admitted from the eve in Bordeaux \"In an isolated room\" and \"it is well\", although before confirming the disease of it \"he was in contact with a dozen people from the return of him to France.\" The health authorities are going to \"contact\" those people, to verify the health status of it, he said.\nLess is known about the two Parisian cases. From the first announced, Buzyn revealed that she is entered at the Bichat Hospital in the capital. \"We know that this person traveled to China, but we do not know if he was in Wuhan,\" the minister, professional doctor added. In a statement to the mid-night edge, the ministry of it indicated that another case was confirmed that was being investigated, and that is related to one of the first patients. The third affected, who have not given data beyond that he was also in China, is also admitted to Paris. \"All measures of isolation and hygiene have been taken,\" said the Ministry of Health.\nBuzyn has insisted that \"it is possible\" to locate new affected in France, although she has assured that everything possible is being done to \"contain\" the spread of the virus by the country. The Minister has asked for returning travelers from China than , before the smallest discomfort, do not go to hospital emergency services but by contacting the health authorities before, \"to avoid all potential contagion.\"\nMeanwhile, in Spain, the Public Health Directorate and Addictions of the Basque Government Health Department has been notified this afternoon from a suspect case associated with the Coronavirus of Chinese origin. It is a woman who has recently returned from Wuhan province in China and presents pathologies linked to this disease. The affected is entered into isolation at the University Hospital of Cruces, according to Europe Press. The Basque Department of Health has reported that the analytical sample has already been sent to the National Microbiology Center of Majadahonda, reference laboratory to carry out this specific analysis and is planned to have the result in the next 24-48 hours.\nIn addition, two other cases that were studied in Spain as suspected by the coronavirus of Wuhan have given negative. This has not been reported by the Ministry of Health on Friday afternoon after the Director of the Health Coordination and Emergencies Center of the Ministry of Health, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, reported that same day that two people were being studied by possible contagion, since Both recently arrived in Spain from the Chinese city origin of infection with some symptoms.\nThe Sanitary Authorities of the United States have confirmed this Friday a second case in the country of aggressive Coronavirus. Like the first case, detected during the last weekend in Seattle, it is a person who recently traveled to the city of Wuhan, epicenter of the health crisis.\nSo far, the virus has caused 41 deaths, all in China, all but two in the Wuhan region. More than 1,100 have been contaminated in that country, of which almost two hundred are in a serious state. Authorities are also monitoring 1,072 suspected cases.

Among other things, the electronics industry is affected. Not only imports are disturbed, but also deliveries to China.\nActually, the EU trading ministers wanted to advise on Thursday about the topic, but the meeting is canceled. The average transport duration of China to Europe on the sea amounts to six weeks, over land transport on the new Silk Road is about three weeks. Therefore, the effects of the Chinese coronastilland now propagate with delay for production and trade in Europe.\nWith imports of 52 billion euros, China is the \"by far the largest foreign supplier for the German electric market,\" says Andreas Gontermann, the Chief Volkswirt of the Central Association Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry (ZVEI). \"The delivery difficulties do not affect the industry nationwide,\" he says. \"However, a number of companies report on disturbances in the delivery and production chains.\"\nGontermann quarters the volume of prepaid products delivered from China to Germany to a value of 10 billion euros a year. \"How much of this is dangered, can be difficult to estimate,\" says Gontermann. And that's not done yet: \"In addition, forces from other countries can also contain Chinese inputs,\" he explains. Thus, the Japanese and the South Korean economy are currently only slowed, both countries are very important for the electronics industry.\nConsumers are also likely to feel the effects in the electric markets. \"Currently no delivery bottlenecks can be found by the restrictions of the coronavirus, at present we expect for April with first possible delivery bottlenecks and rising commitment prices,\" says Alexander Maier, Senior Vice President at Ingram Micro, a Munich suburb Ashheim-based wholesaler for electro- and Electronic products. \"We are currently working on strategies to quickly respond to these effects and continue to offer our customers the best possible availability.\"\nThe car industry is also worried. \"Currently the production runs at all locations,\" says an Audi spokeswoman in Ingolstadt. \"Of course it is not to be foreseen how the situation will develop in the medium term - especially with regard to the supply chain -. Any threatening bottlenecks are trying to cushion through targeted measures.\"\nAudi is in Bavaria, where companies are particularly dependent on foreign countries and generate more than half of their sales outside the German boundaries. \"Supply Chains between China and Bavaria are interrupted and are even more interrupted from today's perspective in the coming weeks if, for example, pre-crisis products are processed and no further offspring,\" says Bertram Brossardt, the main executive of the Association of the Bavarian Economy (VBW).\nThe most important import funds from China for the Bavarian economy are data processing equipment, electronic and optical products, electrical equipment and machinery. \"We expect an interruption of supply chains in approximately proportional to the volume of individual product groups,\" says Brossardt. This is likely to be analogous to companies in the rest of the republic supplied from China.\nNot to be estimated for outsiders are the impact on the supply of medicines. According to the Federal Institute for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices in Bonn, there are currently no coronavirus-related bottlenecks. But India - where many imitators are manufactured for the world market, has limited the export of 26 common active ingredients, including paracetamol and several antibiotics.\nA significant wholesaler for medication is the Mannheim-based Phoenix PharmaHandel - and the company walls: \"We can not rate the topic of your request,\" says a spokesman.

A new virus has China on alert. It is a mysterious pneumonia, from which dozens of people have been infected in the city of Wuhan and that corresponds to a new strain of a coronavirus similar to that in 2002 caused the epidemic of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, for its acronym in English). This has been confirmed by Chinese National Television, CCTV, according to the investigations of a group of scientists who has managed to isolate the genetic sequence of the infectious agent.\nMedical tests have confirmed the presence of this new pathogen in 15 of the 59 cases detected since the beginning of December, all of them in Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province. The origin of most of these infections has been located in a fish and seafood market, in which living animals were marketed. Since then, the area has remained closed and quarantined. To date, none of the patients has died and even eight patients, which no longer showed any symptoms, were discharged on Wednesday. Local health authorities have ensured that no transmission between human has been detected.\nThe Coronavirus, who receive their name by the crown form that adopt views of the Miscroscope, usually attack the respiratory tract of mammals. To date, only six were known. Four provoke mild symptoms similar to those of a cold. The other two, on the other hand, are sadly famous: in 2002, the SARS Coronavirus, originated in China, caused the death of more than 700 people around the world; While in 2015 the MERS (respiratory syndrome of the Middle East) left 449 dead.\nGiven the antecedents, the news has been received with concern in the country. \"I am very afraid. I remember that the SARS appeared next to the Spring Festival and then expanded thanks to the means of transport, \"wrote a user at Weibo, a social network similar to Twitter. The words of him refer to the Chinese New Year, which in 2020 will take place on January 25. On the occasion of this national festival, it is a tradition that people return to the family home, causing the greatest human migration of the world, with more than 3,000 million displacements: an ideal scenario for the spread of a virus.\nThe mysterious ailment, however, could have already jumped off the borders of the Asian giant. In South Korea, a woman of Chinese nationality has been put into isolation before the possibility that she is infected, the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Center (KCDC) reported on Wednesday. The 36-year-old woman was diagnosed on Tuesday with pneumonia, after two business trips in which she among other cities visited Wuhan. Neighboring countries, meanwhile, have begun to extreme security measures at airports.\nThe World Health Organization does not consider it necessary, at the moment, to establish special measures for travelers. This has been announced in a communiqu\u00e9 made public this morning, ensuring that \"new coronavirus appear periodically [...] and China has a solid health system, capable of responding and managing outbreaks of respiratory infections.\" The institution, which has shown its willingness to provide technical support to the health authorities of the country, has sentenced that \"in the coming weeks it will be necessary to need more comprehensive information to better understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak\".\nIn the same direction, scientists responsible for identifying the virus have been expressed, ensuring that their initial finding must be completed with more research. Although it is possible to obtain evidence of the presence of pathogens in a short period of time, the production of a vaccine can take years. Professor David Hui Shu-Cheong, expert in respiratory medicine at Hong Kong Chinese University, has ensured South China Morning Post still need to clarify some key details such as \"What animal is the source of the virus, the incubation period and The transmission path \".

LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China\u2019s domestic coal mines are struggling to ramp up production in the face of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. That\u2019s a situation that may seem positive for seaborne exporters, but in reality it may be challenging for miners to take advantage.\nWhile there may be increased demand for imported coal in China in coming weeks, the problem for major exporters such as Indonesia, Australia and the United States is going to be one of logistics.\nThe coronavirus is starting to have an impact on supply chains and will make it more challenging for shippers to find vessels to go to China. And even if exporters do get their goods to Chinese ports, they will likely face headaches in unloading cargoes and transporting them from docks to end-users.\nBy Thursday, the country\u2019s health authority said, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan had reached 563, with more than 28,000 others infected.\nWhile the fatalities and infections draw headlines, the impact of the virus is starting to cascade through China\u2019s economy - as well as businesses in countries that trade heavily with the world\u2019s largest consumer of commodities.\nThe challenge of shipping coal to China was illustrated by the Australian government\u2019s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on vessels leaving mainland China after Feb. 1.\nThis means such vessels will face delays upon reaching Australian ports, as the sailing time between China and both the east and west coasts of Australia is generally less than 14 days.\nVessel queues outside Australian coal ports are already lengthening. Argus Media reported on Feb. 4 that the number of ships waiting outside Newcastle, the world\u2019s largest coal export harbor, was at an 18-month high of 20 vessels.\nThere are some other factors that may be contributing to longer vessel waiting times, such as weather and port and rail maintenance, but the overall trend is clear: Shipments to, as well as from, China are becoming more complicated to arrange.\nOne thing that is working in exporters\u2019 favor is a sharp decline in shipping rates. The rate to ship coal from Newcastle to China dropped to $5.87 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest in almost four years and about a third of the $16.49 peak reached in September last year.\nAt these freight prices, shipping companies will be losing money on every voyage, while they are also facing higher costs from the mandatory switch to cleaner fuels that kicked in last month as part of a change in global shipping regulations known as IMO2020.\nWhile the cost of shipping may be depressed, the main challenge will be securing vessels with owners prepared to send them to China.\nCertainly, Asian seaborne coal prices have yet to show any meaningful spike from China\u2019s domestic coal woes.\nThe price of 6,000 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at Newcastle, as assessed by brokers Tullett Prebon climbed to $69.35 a tonne on Thursday, up from a recent low of $66.30 on Feb. 3, but still below the high so far this year of $72 on Jan. 13.\nThe price of lower-quality 4,200 kcal/kg coal from Indonesia has fared better, with the weekly Argus index rising to a six-month high of $35.48 a tonne in the week ended Jan. 31.\nThe rise in the Indonesian coal price follows similar gains in domestic prices in China, with thermal coal at Qinhuangdao, as assessed by SteelHome ending at 563 yuan ($80.66) on Wednesday, down slightly from 564 yuan on Feb. 4, which was the highest in three months.\nThe coal market appears to be reacting with caution to the coronavirus, with still considerable uncertainty over how much domestic output has been lost, what transport bottlenecks exist currently in China and whether more imported coal will be needed. Even if it is, can it get there efficiently?\nWhat is becoming clearer is that the efforts to contain the virus by limiting economic activity in China is going to have multiple flow-on effects through commodity supply chains.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

NORWICH: The SARS outbreak in 2002 to 2003 was the first global pandemic of the 21st century. \n There were over 8,400 reported cases and 11 per cent of those infected with the virus died. Its cause was a newly identified coronavirus (a type of virus that causes respiratory infections): SARS Co-V. \n Early cases were linked to wildlife markets and restaurants in Guangdong, China, where researchers found SARS-like coronaviruses in animals including masked palm civets and a racoon dog. \n A Chinese government team subsequently reported that 66 out of 508 wildlife handlers tested in other markets across Guangdong were positive for antibodies to the SARS virus. \n The Chinese authorities responded by imposing a temporary ban on the hunting, sale, transportation and export of all wild animals in southern China. They also quarantined or culled civets reared for human consumption in the many civet farms across the area. \n THE WILDLIFE TRADE THREATENS HUMAN HEALTH \n Civets testing positive for SARS may have secondary infections rather than being the source of the virus. \n They were probably infected during the \u201cspeed dating\u201d of zoonotic viruses circulating among the jumble of different animal species packed together at markets or while being transported to markets, often in China. \n At the Royal Society\u2019s international conference on Lessons from SARS in 2004 and in the related publication, we emphasised that wildlife trade was a threat to human health and a primary cause of biodiversity decline in China and South-East Asia. \n But here we are again, 17 years later, with another novel zoonotic coronavirus, this time in Wuhan, China. Once again, initial human cases were linked to a market selling a variety of live animals. \n A constantly changing range of species have been selected as the culprits in the past few days, including bats and snakes, (the latter results were quickly refuted), and even crickets and wolf cubs. \n But, as yet, there is no scientific evidence that the virus has been isolated from any of these, although a recent report stated that \u201c15 environmental specimens collected in the western section (of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) were positive for 2019-nCoV virus through testing and genetic sequencing analysis\u201d. \n  \n The report continues: \u201cDespite extensive searching, no animal from the market has thus far been identified as a possible source of infection.\u201d \n It is not evident what \u201cenvironmental specimens\u201d refers to here and a complete list of those animals present in, or available from, the market would be appropriate to release together with details of which and how many of these have so far been tested. \n Wild rodents, which are often present in these markets, should also have been collected and tested as SARS-like coronaviruses have also been isolated from wild rats in China. \n PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR PANDEMICS \n But we may be chasing our tails, as animals testing positive may not be the source of the current outbreak. We need to step back and learn the broader lessons here. \n The perfect conditions for the emergence of human pandemics from previously unknown zoonotic pathogens has been created as a result of three things. \n First, the shift from subsistence hunting of wildlife to its sale into an international trade network largely driven by demand in China. \n Second, the extensive cross-exposure within this wildlife trade of species and species populations, which would not mix or be in contact in the wild. \n And, third, the exploitation of new source populations as areas become depleted of target species. \n  \n It is also important to emphasise that these wild animals are typically now more expensive to buy (sometime a status symbol) than domestic livestock, so the demand that perpetuates wildlife trade in the region is a dietary choice and not driven by low income. \n WILL REMOVING SUCH MARKETS HELP? \n The solution is collective action to remove the demand and also the supply chains to these wildlife markets and \u201cfarms\u201d (often laundering animals from the wild rather than breeding them). \n The call to close wildlife markets across China \u2013 which started following the SARS outbreak \u2013 has also been echoed by experts in China and in external organisations worldwide, such as the Wildlife Conservation Society. \n We have to hope that the Wuhan outbreak is a wake-up call for regulation of wildlife trade and animal health, action that is urgently needed to protect human health and the environment. \n Diana Bell is Professor of Conservation Biology, University of East Anglia.

Last Wednesday (Feb 19), Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat told Bloomberg TV in an interview that the Government has no plans to ease property cooling measures. \n \u201cIt is not on our radar at this point because we need to make sure that we stabilise the economy and we address long term structural issues,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0 \n This is understandable given that the Covid-19 outbreak has led to a percentage point downgrade in the official forecast of Singapore\u2019s economic growth this year. \n At the same time, the outbreak will also have an adverse impact on the private residential market, with spillover effects on the entire real estate value chain and the longer-term stability of the property market.\u00a0 \n Why is this so? \n Let\u2019s take a look at where the market stands today as well as cooling measures such as the Additional Buyer\u2019s Stamp Duty (ABSD). \n Currently, developers now must build and sell all their units in a project within five years to get a remission of the ABSD on the land purchase price. \n Otherwise they will have to pay the 25 per cent ABSD, with interest. \n ABSD was 10 per cent when it was introduced in Dec 2011, before it was\u00a0raised to 15 per cent in July 2013 and the current 25 per cent in July 2018. \n In 2020, developers are going to launch some 10,402 units from 48 projects, based on Cushman & Wakefield Research\u2019s estimate. Of these, 4,765 units or 46 per cent will come from the luxury segment or the Core Central Region (CCR) segment. \n Traditionally, about 28 per cent of the buyers of CCR homes are permanent residents and foreigners from China, which has been hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Singapore has since banned travellers who have visited mainland China recently, and the majority of that includes Chinese passport holders who could be the potential buyers of these luxury units. In 2019, non-PR China buyers bought a total of 359 units, of which 141 units were in the CCR. \n At a broader level, demand for private residential units might slow to a trickle soon, judging from the market reactions in our neighbouring countries affected by Covid-19. \n As an indication of how far sales could fall, China home sales plunged by 90 per cent in the first week of February compared to the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data on 36 cities compiled by China Merchants Securities Co.\u00a0 \n Before the virus outbreak, the Singapore market was already expecting a more challenging sales environment in the coming months due to resistance to high prices and launch fatigue especially for smaller developments. The mood is now more bearish due to the virus outbreak. \n The temporary shortage of labour will also have an impact on the property market. \n Construction companies have expressed concerns about failing to meet deadlines due to workers from China not being able to return to Singapore and quarantine orders placed on affected workers in the industry. \n The authorities have urged developers not to penalise contractors and subcontractors for the unexpected delays. \n Beyond a temporary labour shortage , construction companies face a bigger and complex challenge arising from the global supply chain disruption caused by the lock-down in many China cities, with factories remaining shut or operating with reduced capacity. \n In Singapore, construction material and finished products are not expected to arrive in time for assembly or use. As manufacturers in China and the entire world are so interdependent, it is hard to predict how soon manufacturing would resume and at what capacity. \n What has made the situation more dire for Singapore construction firms is the mandatory adoption of the pre-fabricated pre-finished volumetric construction (PPVC) method at many Government Land Sales sites. \n Modern construction technology such as PPVC requires all components to be assembled off-site before they are delivered to the project site under construction. These include door, glass panels, tiles, sanitary ware etc. It does not allow construction to proceed if there is just one missing item. \n Although the current supply chain disruption would likely impact all stages of construction, the impact on PPVC construction would be more pronounced. \n The construction delay and the ripple effect beyond the short to medium term could have serious repercussions on the already fragile residential market. \n In about two to three years\u2019 time, the Singapore residential market could deal with a supply overhang arising from the enbloc boom between 2017 and 2018. \n At the same time, all developers are bound by a five-year ABSD remission deadline that is fast approaching amid slower sales. \n On the supply front, there are 49,173 uncompleted private residential units (excluding executive condominiums) with planning approval. \n Of this, 30,162 remain unsold. There are also an additional 4,575 private residential units that do not have planning approval yet. \n Based on the 9,912 units sold in 2019, it should take developers roughly about five years to clear the existing stock and narrowly escape the ABSD penalty, assuming sales momentum in 2019 can be maintained this year. \n Looking at how things are now, it is unlikely that developers will be able to sell their projects at the same pace as previously anticipated.\u00a0 \n In short, they could be hit with a double whammy \u2013 construction delays and potentially missing the ABSD deadline due to unforeseen circumstances which are no fault of theirs. \n Developers could slash prices drastically to try to move units but this could have a destabilising effect on the market as a whole. \n It is still fairly early days and how long the outbreak will last and how exactly it will affect the broader economy and the property market is still unclear.\u00a0 \n But if the outbreak worsens, there is a case to be made for the authorities to extend the current ABSD deadline. \n The point is not only to provide much needed relief for developers, but to cushion the impact on the property sector. \n As it is, the current ABSD rule is too blunt a tool, as it does not differentiate the larger projects of hundreds or even thousands of units, from the smaller ones. \n As the economy is expected to head south, the larger projects have a much higher chance of missing the deadline, as they typically require a much longer time to sell out all the units especially during challenging times like now. \n An extension of the ABSD deadline would help developers to stagger new home sales and manage risks better arising from supply overhang. \n It would go a long way to help the market, long after the virus blows over, to avert a worst-case scenario that housing units are dumped in the open market in a disorderly manner, hurting both\u00a0consumers and the economy. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Christine Li is head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia at global property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield.

SINGAPORE \u2014 The Singapore stock market on Monday (March 9) suffered its largest single-day drop since October 2008, as markets around the globe were battered following\u00a0a plunge in oil prices that\u00a0fuelled rising alarm over the economic impact of Covid-19. \n After weeks of slow and gradual decline, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI)\u00a0nosedived 6 per cent \u2014\u00a0shedding 178.61 points to 2,782.37. \n It was the worst fall since the height of the global financial crisis and dragged the main market index to its lowest levels since 2016. \n The massive selloff across the globe was triggered by a plunge in\u00a0oil prices after the world\u2019s major oil producers failed to reach an agreement on cutting production, which sparked a price-cutting war in an environment where supply is exceeding waning demand. \n Among many global losers, Japan\u2019s Nikkei sank 5 per cent and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 dived 7.3 per cent. \n Market experts in Singapore warned investors not to take their chances during such turbulent times, and to leave the analysis and guesswork to the professionals. \n The STI, an index which tracks the performance of the top 30 companies listed on the Singapore Exchange, saw all three banks here \u2014 DBS, OCBC and UOB \u2014 fall by at least 6 per cent. Conglomerate Keppel Corp tanked by almost 10 per cent, Genting Singapore dropped 6 per cent and Singapore Airlines was down 4.5 per cent. \n Analysts warned investors against thinking that this might sound like a good time to enter the stock market and pick up some bargains among blue chips. \n They said that\u00a0this is a time to be extra cautious because the confluence of factors that are causing the current market carnage is unprecedented, and there is no knowing how long the market bloodshed will last. \n WHY DID THE MARKET PLUNGE? \n The plunge in the STI, experts told TODAY, was largely due to a meeting of two \u201cblack swans\u201d\u2014 an oil price war and an airline industry robbed of demand from the Covid-19 outbreak. A black swan event is one that comes as a complete surprise and has\u00a0deep consequences. \n On Friday, Russia refused to join the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in a large production cut as the Covid-19 outbreak continues to slow the global economy along with the demand for oil, the New York Times reported. \n In retaliation, Saudi Arabia decided to cut oil prices by nearly 10 per cent on Saturday. \n Price wars such as\u00a0these have led to steep falls in oil prices before, as in 2016. However, experts said\u00a0that with the Covid-19 outbreak looming in the background, there are no \u201cwinners\u201d in this situation. \n Mr Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking, said that when there is a sharp fall in oil prices, there will normally be winners and losers, but in this instance, it is a \u201closer-loser\u201d situation. \n \u201cNormally, the airline industry has been the primary beneficiary of such a sharp plunge in oil prices. Now , no one wants to take (a plane). \n \u201cHad it just been the oil price war without the coronavirus outbreak fears, we would all be travelling to Japan for S$1 priced tickets. But now, even with that pricing, we would be scared to go,\u201d he said. \n Ms Pan Jingyi, a market strategist at brokerage firm IG, said that besides the fall in oil prices, the increase in the number of infections outside of China has caused negative sentiment in the market. \n This is due to the growth in Covid-19 cases in countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea, where case numbers have spiked from the tens to the thousands in the span of weeks. \n \u201cThe backdrop still being the coronavirus impact\u00a0that\u2019s causing quite a lot of turmoil in the market,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hit on demand is already the general situation in the market, and the market has processed that in.\u201d \n WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO? \n Mr Terence Wong, chief executive officer of fund management\u00a0company Azure Capital, said that due to the \u201cmany unknowns out there\u201d, punters should not be investing \u201caggressively\u201d at the moment. \n \u201cIt could have other impacts on other parts of the economy that you may not think about,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you asked me last week, I couldn\u2019t tell that this would happen\u2026 There will be a high degree of risk (to invest) right now.\u201d \n Agreeing, Mr Song said that investment during such dire circumstances should be left to the professionals. \n \u201cWe have the virus outbreak plus a price war, I don\u2019t think laymen are equipped to deal with this kind of fluid landscape,\u201d he said. \n Though the experts generally warned against investing during this period of turmoil, there could be a sliver of opportunity for those willing to take the risk. \n If one had to choose certain industries to invest in, it should be more stable\u00a0industries such as primarily consumer staples, which includes producers of food, household goods and other essentials, Ms Pan said. \n Mr Song added that the healthcare sector, especially health care services and medical equipment manufacturers, are set to do well during this period. \n A larger risk would be to invest in cyclical stocks, those that are tied to the business cycle, Ms Pan said. These include companies in the industrial sector or those that deal with energy production. \n WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE STOCK MARKET \n The rate at which the market will recover depends not just on the spread of the virus, but the fear among the population, the\u00a0analysts\u00a0said. \n Mr Wong of Azure Capital believes that the market will recover when the number of cases stabilises. Now that the number of cases is still \u201cjumping around\u201d, this will cause uncertainty in the market, he said. \n \u201cIf you look at China, the number of new cases has already been decreasing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, globally, we didn\u2019t see wild numbers\u2026 I think we could have already made a recovery in the market.\u201d \n Mr Song agreed that consumer fears play a bigger role in curbing demand than the actual number of cases does. \n \u201c(Chances of a rebound) depends on how confident market participants are about the outbreak being contained, the most important being the fear factor,\u201d he said. \n However, when a rebound will come is hard to tell, which makes it difficult to know when one should start investing again. \n Ms Pan said: \u201cWith every market shock, there will be a recovery, but the problem this time is that we are dealing with something that is very uncertain (with the) coronavirus. Perhaps we will need to see a vaccine come through, to be a remedy (to the economy).\u201d \n In the meantime, players in the market can only hope that the worst will be over soon, but there is no indication of how big the hit on the market will continue to be, or how long it will last. \n The analysts said that they expect the STI to fall further to around 2,500-point levels, down from the current 2,782. \n In the last\u00a0five years,\u00a0STI closed at its lowest of\u00a02,539 points in February 2016. \n Mr Wong said that\u00a0it is ultimately wiser to hold off investing during\u00a0an uncertain economy rather than hope to profit from it. \n \u201cYou can see the tide coming, but you can\u2019t tell how big it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a ripple, that\u2019s fine. But what if it builds up to a tsunami wave? \n \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be a hero\u2026 I still think that cash (rather than investments) will be king right now.\u201d "}, {"content": "WRAPUP 4-U.S. could be next 'virus epicentre', as India locks down, global recession looms.

SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Wednesday (Jan 22) that it is setting up a multi-ministry task force to tackle the mysterious Wuhan virus that has already infected more than 400 people in China. \n Although it has yet to reach Singapore's shores, increased air travel in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holidays has led to the ministry - as well as other agencies across the world - stepping up precautionary measures to either prevent entry of the disease or contain its spread. \n As of Wednesday afternoon, the Wuhan virus, a type of coronavirus which causes pneumonia in its victims, has claimed nine lives. \n But what is the virus and how did the Wuhan virus spread to people? \n Here are some questions and answers about the Wuhan coronavirus behind the latest outbreak. \n Viruses are microscopic parasites that lack the ability to survive and reproduce outside living organisms, which includes animal, humans and even bacteria. \n For this reason, it is debatable if they are truly \"alive\". They become active only when they come into contact with living cells, which they then try to hijack to produce more viruses. \n Even so, viruses are made of biological material and have the biggest population of any biological entity on earth, triggering responses in living things that range from unnoticeable reactions to death. \n Some experts believe that nearly 10 per cent of the current human genome is viral genetic material, as a result of viruses infecting human cells for millennia. \n They belong to a large group of viruses that usually\u00a0infect only animals, and are so named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. \n But from the mid-1960s, scientists began identifying coronaviruses that affect humans, with seven types of these viruses classified to date, according to the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. \n Four of these typically cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, with well-known symptoms such as sore throats, cough, and headaches. \n But the remaining three have more recently caused severe repercussions on human health as scientists scrambled to understand them. \n The first is the infectious\u00a0severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) coronavirus, which killed almost 800 people in 32 countries 17 years ago. \n The other two are the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Mers-CoV), which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread further, and the latest Wuhan virus (2019-nCov)\u00a0which killed its first victims in the Chinese city of Wuhan. \n Scientists have speculated that the virus from the latest Wuhan outbreak, like the Mers and Sars viruses that preceded it, evolved from coronavirus strains that previously affected only animals. \n This ability of a virus to \"jump\" from animals to humans is not unusual and has given rise to a category of illnesses called zoonotic diseases Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters"}, {"content": "Beijing quarantines returning residents as China struggles to pick up economy.

A research error of the authors of a brief article published in the form of a letter by the prestigious magazine The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) last Thursday has revived the scientific debate on one of the key issues still to be resolved from the epidemic of the Wuhan Coronavirus: If asymptomatic patients can transmit the disease.\nThe writing ensured that a Chinese worker in the automotive sector had contaged the disease to two colleagues - and one of them to two others - of the German headquarters during a training course. \"During her stay, she had been well and without symptoms of the infection, but she became ill during the flight back to China,\" the researchers published.\nThe authors, however, had not spoken with women. One of them, Michael Hoelscher, from the Hospital of the University of Munich, has explained to Science magazine that were the fellow infected by those who explained that she is \"she did not seem to have any symptoms\" \u00b7\nThe German public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute, did it later and the woman explained that she had felt \"tired, with muscle aches . This has led the Institute to send a letter to the NEJM requesting a rectification of the article and to inform the World Health Organization (WHO) and the rest of European agencies on the new findings.\nThe article had a great impact on the scientific community since it was the first published in a prestigious magazine that confirmed the advanced by the Chinese Minister of Health, Ma Xiaowei, on Sunday, January 26: that the people who developed the disease could do Transmit the virus since days before showing the first symptoms.\n\"There is no doubt after reading the article that transmission from asymptomatic patients is occurring,\" said the director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Allergies of the United States, Anthony Fauki. Large media around the world, including the country, also echoed what is published by Nejm for its relevance.\nDespite what happened with Nejm, Fauci is convinced that the contagion of asymptomatic people are happening. \"I have called one of my colleagues in China, who is a highly respected scientist, and has told me that it is convinced that some people are studying asymptomatic infection and that some asymptomatic infected are transmitting the disease\" , Fauci has explained to Science magazine.\nThe possibility that asymptomatic patients can spread the coronavirus alert to experts for the difficulties that this would involve in the control of the expansion of the pathogen. It would oblige, for example, to expand the contact studies of the patients diagnosed on days prior to the development of symptoms and would subtract usefulness to control measures adopted at many airports, such as body temperature surveillance.\nThat the incubation periods - when a sick person already has the virus but still does not suffer from symptoms - and when it is capable of transmitting them-overlap a few days is not infrequent in infectious diseases, also respiratory. Therefore doctors and scientists await almost from the first phases of the Wuhan epidemic information and studies that provide light on whether this occurs.\n\"It is something that would increase the uncertainty about the effect of some of the prevention measures adopted,\" explained to this newspaper last Friday Jesus Rodr\u00edguez Bath, Head of Service of Infectious Diseases of the Virgin Macarena Hospital (Seville). \"The detection of asymptomatic cases will have implications when we know if this happens always or only in some cases. Several incognites remain to be resolved, \"added the International Health Service Physician from Barcelona Hospital and Isglobal Researcher.\nBoth researchers agree that the issue is still unanswered. Although they emphasize that \"in any case, the expansion of the coronavirus is being mainly for patients and sick and if the transmissions in asymptomatic exist, they have a secondary role in the evolution of the outbreak\".\nIn his daily report on the evolution of the epidemic, WHO held last Saturday that he has news of \"the possible transmission of 2019-ncov\", a provisional name given to the pathogen, \"of some people infected before they develop symptoms.\" The Agency was referred to investigations underway \"to better understand the preclinical phases of the infection and how transmissions may have occurred.\" In any case, WHO also maintains that this type of contagion \"does not seem to be an important virus transmission path\".

Oil prices jumped on the reports.  \n Asked about the reports, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the WHO recommends enrolment into a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy and safety.\"  \n The process of developing and testing drugs or vaccines against a new pathogen normally takes many years and is often fraught with pitfalls and failures.  \n Even at the accelerated pace enabled by new technologies, the earliest that scientists hope to be able to start initial human trials of a new coronavirus vaccine is by June this year.  \n Doctors looking for ways to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus are likely to try antiviral medicines licensed for use against other viral infections to see if they might help, as well as potential antiviral drugs still in development.  \n The U.S. drugmaker Gilead says it has started clinical trials of patients in China infected with the new coronavirus, using an experimental drug called remdesivir, but stressed that this work is investigational at this stage.  \n \"It is not approved anywhere globally,\" a Gilead spokesman told Reuters in Beijing.  \n Gilead said it had increased manufacturing of remdesivir to create a stockpile that might be used in future viral disease outbreaks. \"We are doing this before knowing whether the drug is safe and effective to treat 2019-nCoV,\" the spokesman said.

SHANGHAI - Scientists in China studying the coronavirus outbreak said they had found two main types of the disease could be causing infections.  \n The researchers, from Peking University's School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, cautioned that their analysis examined a limited range of data, and said follow-up studies of larger data sets are needed to better understand the virus's evolution.  \n The preliminary study found that a more aggressive type of the new coronavirus associated with the disease outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70% of analysed strains, while 30% was linked to a less aggressive type.  \n The prevalence of the more aggressive virus decreased after early January 2020, they said.  \n \"These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),\" they wrote.  \n Their findings were published on Tuesday in the National Science Review, the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  \n Also on Wednesday, one of China's top medical associations confirmed that the median incubation period of the coronavirus is five to seven days and the maximum 14 days.  \n The remarks by Du Bin, chairman of the critical care medical branch of the Chinese Medical Association, mark the most conclusive assessment of the virus' incubation period by a government-affiliated medical organization to date.  \n The revelations came amid a fall in new coronavirus cases following crippling restrictions imposed on the world's second largest economy to stop its spread, including transport suspensions and the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday.  \n  \n NEW CASES DOWN  \n Mainland China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of February.  \n The total number of cases on the mainland has now reached 80,270. The number of deaths rose by 38 to bring the total toll for mainland China to 2,981 by March 3.  \n All but one new death occurred in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak.  \n With the number of new daily infections overseas now exceeding new cases in China, Chinese officials have begun to seek ways to control the spread of the virus outside of China and guard against future outbreaks.  \n Authorities have asked overseas Chinese hoping to return home to reconsider their travel plans, while cities across the country have set up quarantine rules for those entering from high-risk places.  \n An infected person is known to have arrived in China from Iran, one of the virus' new hotspots, last week.  \n China is encouraging domestic producers of medical protective equipment to export protective suits to meet overseas demand as the virus spreads, Cao Xuejun, an official with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.  \n China's health authorities are also studying setting up emergency reserves for medical resources and protective materials, Mao Qunan, an official at China's National Health Commission said at the same briefing.

There are concerns that the novel coronavirus infection is ditching desperate attempts that are being made by different governments to contain it. What is alarming is that the pandemic is accelerating in many countries.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) fears that after Europe, the United States is on the course of becoming the next hotspot of Covid-19. India is among the countries that are being anxiously followed by WHO and others.\nTo understand how grave the situation of novel coronavirus spread is, let us check the numbers of its progression globally. On December 31, China informed the WHO about cases of pneumonia due to some mysterious ailment in Wuhan city. There have been reports, however, about a viral outbreak in Wuhan.\nOn January 5, China ruled out a coronavirus outbreak saying it was not a SARS virus recurrence (sever acute respiratory syndrome), an illness that had turned epidemic after its outbreak in China and Hong Kong in 2002.\nTwo days later on January 7, China announced having identified the virus as novel coronavirus - 2019-nCoV. On January 11, China reported first death due to novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan. Second death was reported on January 17.\nBetween two novel coronavirus deaths, Covid-19 cases were reported from Thailand and Japan. Soon countries including South Korea, the US, France, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Nepal reported cases of novel coronavirus infection. But all cases were traced to infection in China.\nOn January 31, the WHO declared novel coronavirus outbreak an \"international emergency\" recognizing it as a risk to other countries. China had by then report nearly 9,700 cases and 213 deaths due to novel coronavirus.\nThe disease was spreading fast but it accelerated after it reached 1 lakh-mark globally. The WHO said it took 67 days for Covid-19 outbreak to infect first 1 lakh patients on March 7.\nBut to infect another 1 lakh people, the coronavirus took just 12 days. On March 19, the numbers crossed 2 lakh. During this phase, the daily count of fresh novel coronavirus cases kept rising consistently barring on a few days. (See table below)\nThe next 1 lakh patients got Covid-19 in just four days, with global count crossing 3 lakh on March 23. On March 25, the WHO count for global Covid-19 patients crossed 4 lakh. It means the last 1 lakh novel coronavirus patients were added to the list in just two days.\nTotal deaths as on March 25 due to Covid-19 stood at 18,440 with more than 2200 losing the battle against novel coronavirus in the last 24 hours, according to WHO report.\nNow compare this trend with the trend in India.\nIndia reported its first Covid-19 case on January 30. It was the same day that the WHO declared novel coronavirus a global emergency.\nBy February 3, there were three cases in India.\nOn February 20, all three Covid-19 patients were discharged after they recovered from infection.\nBy February 28, India had tested 2,880 samples, of which 1,572 were samples from outside quarantine centres. Only three had tested positive.\nMarch 2, two cases were reported - one each from Delhi and Hyderabad.\nOn March 10, the Covid-19 cases reached 50 and on March 15 it crossed 100-mark (107). On March 20 - with 50 new cases - novel coronavirus cases jumped to 223. That is, India reported 105 cases in 13 days between March 2 and 5. But in just next five days, the country recorded 118 more cases.\nIn another four days, the number crossed 500 on March 24, when official number of Covid-19 patients was 519. That is, India saw almost 300 fresh cases after it breached 200-mark.\nAt noon on March 26, the official data put the number of Covid-19 patients at 649, 593 of them being active cases treated in different hospitals. That is, in 15 days (March 11-26), coronavirus cases in India increased nearly 13 times.\nThe official death count due to novel coronavirus infection stood at 13 while 42 Covid-19 have been cured and discharged from hospitals.\nClearly, India is following the same pattern as other novel coronavirus-affected countries across continents. The only relief here is that the number is not phenomenal given India's proximity to China and its huge population base. But some say the lower number is due to fewer than required testing done by government agencies in India.\nNow that national lockdown has been enforced, the authorities hope the accelerated rate of increase in novel coronavirus cases will slow down in days to come.

The response to coronavirus resembles the inverse of a speculative mania, with fear replacing greed, and errors of pessimism those of optimism.\nIn his engaging and eerily well-timed new book, \u201cThe Rules of Contagion\u201d, Adam Kucharski observes that bubbles and diseases go through similar growth phases. Both experience periods of exponential growth. Eventually the spread peaks, the bubble bursts and the number of infections declines sharply. A typical outbreak chart resembles an inverted \u201cV\u201d. Bubbles follow a similar trajectory.\u00a0As the ecologist Robert May observed in 2013, \u201cthe recent rise in financial assets and the subsequent crash have rather precisely the same shape as the typical rise and fall of cases in an outbreak of measles or other infections.\u201d\nFinancial bubbles and epidemics are both prone to cross borders. In 1720, the genie of speculation jumped from Paris to London, and later spread as far as Portugal and Russia. In the early months of 2020, Covid-19 was carried from Wuhan, China to much of the rest of the world. Bubbles produce unreal times: rumours abound and bizarre promotions are launched. Speculators snapped up shares 300 years ago in a company \u201cfor the immediate, expeditious and cleanly manner of emptying necessary houses [toilets] throughout England.\u201d Their descendants have lately taken to stockpiling toilet rolls, a product that England still produces in ample quantity. In an atmosphere of dread, gossip and tall tales spread more virulently than the virus itself.\nBubbles are a form of social contagion. When the markets are soaring, \u201cfear of missing out\u201d drives investors. They lose the capacity to make reasoned judgments. Herd-like behaviour and groupthink prevail. Bullish narratives proliferate. It\u2019s not just that speculators want to hear such stories: Wall Street is incentivised to circulate them. Optimistic visions are maintained in the face of contradictory evidence. During the late 1990s dotcom boom, for instance, Wall Street claimed that internet traffic was doubling every ten weeks. In fact, as researcher Andrew Odlyzko, now at the University of Minnesota, revealed at the time, traffic was growing one-tenth that fast. This inconvenient finding was ignored, and the investment splurge continued, leading to billions of dollars in misallocated capital and the bankruptcy of numerous telecoms firms, including Worldcom.\nThe coronavirus panic has a familiar ring. Charts of reported Italian deaths rising vertically recall bitcoin\u2019s trajectory a couple of years ago. Friends and contacts have taken to forwarding articles by an alarmist coronavirus commentator (not a professional epidemiologist) who boasts millions of readers and claims that his article is the only thing you\u2019ll ever need to read , and will save lives. It\u2019s impossible to say whether this advice is sound or not. But it certainly feels like the pandemic mirror image to the Wall Street pied pipers, such as Henry Blodget, who loudly played their tunes during the internet bubble.\nTrust the experts, we are told: Follow the data and science. If only things were that simple. During the internet and real estate bubbles, financial experts were wrong. A top hedge fund manager once complained to me that \u201cevery bubble has an academic shill.\u201d Epidemiology, like finance, is as much art as science. A colleague and I once gathered data on every bubble we could find. Each one turned out to be different. Epidemiologists face the same problem \u2013 as they like to joke, \u201cif you\u2019ve seen one pandemic, you\u2019ve seen\u2026 one pandemic.\u201d\nBoth investors and epidemiologists face chronic uncertainty. During an epidemic, the data is always changing. Differences in climate and social behavior affect the spread of disease across geographies. This poses enormous challenges when trying to model a pandemic. Like investment strategists, epidemiologists are prone to egregious forecasting errors. In September 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention forecast 1.4 million cases of Ebola in West Africa by the following January. In the end, this epidemic produced fewer than a reported 30,000 cases. An earlier CDC model anticipated a potential smallpox outbreak would result in 77 trillion deaths \u2013 as Kucharski says, both models included an unlimited number of susceptible people.\nCovid-19\u2019s true infection rate is unknown, as outside of South Korea testing has been inadequate and no antibody test is yet available. China cannot be trusted to provide accurate data. As for the fatality rate, Italians may be recording deaths due to coronavirus when other illnesses may also be prevalent. Last week Imperial College predicted more than 2 million people would die in the United States and half a million in the United Kingdom if Covid-19 was not suppressed. Imperial\u2019s dire warning persuaded the U.S. and UK governments into draconian action, shuttering large swathes of the economy. On Monday, Boris Johnson locked down Great Britain.\nYet the assumptions in Imperial\u2019s model \u2013 the reproduction rate, fatality rate, etc. \u2013 are at best educated guesses. The model\u2019s predictions must be hugely sensitive to slight changes in a variety of inputs. Even Imperial admits that what it calls \u201cconservative\u201d assumptions are pessimistic. Such pessimism, or call it excessive caution, appears to be the institutional bias of epidemiologists, just as finance types are prone to hyper-optimism.\nDissenting forces can be heard through the noise. Stanford University epidemiologist John Ioannidis states that analysis of the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship suggests the virus is much less of a danger to life than commonly assumed. Also drawing on the cruise experience, Michael Levitt, the Stanford biophysicist and Nobel laureate, makes a similar point. \u201cWhat we need to control is the panic,\u201d Levitt told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d\nThis calls to mind Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s words to the American people in his first inaugural address at the depth of the Great Depression in 1933: \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is... fear itself \u2013 nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\u201d When the history of this pandemic is written, it may become a postscript to the ever-expanding volume, \u201cExtraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds\u201d, first published in 1841.

Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example.\nIn China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters"}, {"content": "Inaction from Southeast Asia can cause a greater expansion of Coronavirus. The coronavirus of Wuhan (2019-NECOP) expands rapidly by Southeast Asia. With more than half a hundred cases confirmed to date, it is the most affected region in the world. But not all the countries of the environment, most with precarious health systems and very dependent on tourism and Chinese investments, have reacted with a premure. The situation in places like Thailand, the most damaged country after the second world economy with 19 contagion, shoots especially the alarms. For his part, Philippines announced this Sunday the first death out of Asian power: a 44-year-old Chinese male.\n\"Although the numbers (of contagion) outside China are relatively low, there is a potential for a much greater outbreak,\" warned the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros ADHANOM GHEBRAYESUS, by declaring the international emergency on Thursday By the expansion of Coronavirus, which on February 2 leaves a balance of 304 deaths and more than 14,000 infected around the world. A largely founded decision, he explained, in the need to protect those countries that \"do not have the means for their control\".\nSoutheast Asia is a key area in this regard. But although the declaration of the emergency implies a coordination of the international response under WHO, possible new measures could be late in some cases. Thailand already has 19 contagion: one of them is a Thai taxi driver who had displaced four others affected in his vehicle, all from Hubei (Province of which is capital Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus).\nThe local contagion, also occurred in Japan, shoots the greatest fear of the Thai authorities: the appearance of outbreaks in places with great influx of Chinese tourists. \"You can start with a local-scale transmission and then grow at the provincial level,\" he warned the Deputy Director of the Thai Disease Control Department, Tanarak Plipat. A not too distant possibility if it is taken into account that, as said on Thursday, said Department, still about 10,000 tourists from Wuhan are in Thailand. China on Friday a first flight to repatriate them.\nThailand has received a flood of citizen criticism for their crisis management, with the Hashtag \"Crapovernment\" (shit government), counting among the most popular on Twitter last days. The reason: the discontent with the measures taken by the authorities, which until mid-last week did not begin to install thermographic controls for all flights from China. For many Internet users, the country would have preserved the arrival of Chinese tourists to ensure public health. Thailand, where tourism represents between 12% and 20% of GDP, is the first tourist destination of the Chinese abroad. The country calculates losses between 2,200 million and 2,900 million euros due to the fall of Chinese tourism.\nIn addition to the greater or lesser capacity and disposition to start control measures , Another concern is the precariousness of the health systems of many countries in the region. \"We do not know what damage this virus can do if it expands in a country with a weak health system,\" the WHO Director General remarked. Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, is a clear example. With a case detected to date, to the health insufficiencies of the country, where Chinese investment has grown exponentially in recent years, another almost more insane obstacle is added: Hun's renewal, its prime minister.\n\"If the prime minister does not have a mask, why he is going to take her the rest,\" he said this week. Hun Sen, who added that the \"true disease is fear\", ruled out canceling flights from China to not harm the maltimation national economy.\nGeography is another risk factor. The terrestrial borders of the countries of this region that Lindan with China (Vietnam, with three contagious, and Myanmar and Laos, from momentomed of the pathogen) continue open, unlike Russia, which decreed its closure on Thursday. Indonesia, archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, maintains in observation of two possible contagious and ensures increased controls in their countless points of entry.\nFor its part, although the prosperous Singapore has been the first Southeast Asian country to impose the most drastic measures to stop the propagation of the virus, prohibiting entry to all travelers who have been in China in the last two weeks, cases grow daily, reaching 18 February 2. Two of the contagious are women Singaporeans who were repatriated from Wuhan last Thursday.\nUntil a few days free from the pathogen, the Philippines has been the first country outside of China to record a death due to Coronavirus: a 44-year-old Chinese citizen who had arrived from Wuhan with the woman of him, also infected. At the moment they are the only two cases in this country, which hours before death was confirmed, announced the ban on all travel from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao.\nWith China as the main source of tourists for the majority of Southeast Asia, restrictions on entrances of citizens of this country are a hard blow to their economies. Malaysia, where there are eight contagious, has dismissed a controversial popular request to ban the entry to every Chinese citizen.\nTourism has then become a double-edged gun for Southeast Asia. Although it is estimated that it is the main source of contagion, with the Chinese traveling up to ten times more abroad than in 2003, according to the Capital Consultant Economics - in full SARS epidemic, another coronavirus arisen at China - the importance of the sector in The region seems to discourage drastic decision making.

HONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong Airlines started sacking staff on Wednesday (Feb 19), a day after slashing in-flight services to a bare minimum. \n Sources told the South China Morning Post that 170 employees, mostly flight attendants, had been informed that Wednesday would be their last day of work. \n On Tuesday night, the airline said that, starting the next day, it would cut a host of services on all flights, including providing food, drink, pillows and blankets, in what it said was a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d to protect customers and crew during the coronavirus outbreak. \n However, the Post has been told the move is a desperate attempt to cut costs by an airline which was on the brink of collapse at the beginning of the year, and two weeks ago announced it was making 400 staff redundant. \n The measures came after earlier reductions to services, which only affected flights to mainland China. \n In a notice one employee received, the airline said: \u201cWe regret to inform you that based on the company\u2019s recent review of its operational requirements, you will be made redundant.\u201d \n Flight attendants would be paid an extra month, plus accrued but unused annual leave, while severance based on years of service would be taken into account. \n The termination notice ended: \u201cWe would like to thank you for your contribution to the company in the past and we sincerely wish you all the best in your future endeavours.\u201d \n Affected staff have been told to hand back their uniforms on Thursday. \n Unable to pay for in-flight entertainment since December, passengers will need to bring their own devices or reading material to keep themselves entertained with magazines scrapped, while the carrier closed its flagship airport lounge at Hong Kong International Airport on Tuesday. \n \u201cTo further strengthen our precautionary measures and reduce the risk of our crew and customers from being potentially exposed to coronavirus, Hong Kong Airlines will be limiting in-flight cabin activity and making temporary adjustments to our on-board services,\u201d the company said on its website. \n The airline apologised for the inconvenience to customers and said it would continue to monitor the situation and make further in-flight changes accordingly.

No food will be provided on flights, and magazines have been axed, except newspapers or reading materials in seat pockets. \n For more than a year, Hong Kong Airlines has faced lingering questions about its ability to keep operating. \n Last December, the government allowed the company to stay in business after a last-minute cash injection\u00a0\u2014 blamed on the months of civil unrest in Hong Kong, during which fewer people visited the city. \n The coronavirus, which causes a deadly disease known as Covid-19, has pushed the airline once again to the brink of its existence.

US researchers gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine on Monday -- leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges.\nWith a careful jab in a healthy volunteer's arm, scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential Covid-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe.\n\"We're team coronavirus now,\" Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. \"Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.\"\nThe Associated Press observed as the study's first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. Three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart.\n\"We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\" Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle, said as she awaited the shot.\nShe's the mother of two teenagers and \"they think it's cool\" that she's taking part in the study.\nAfter the injection, she left the exam room with a big smile: \"I'm feeling great.\"\nMonday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US National Institutes of Health.\nStill, finding a vaccine \"is an urgent public health priority,\" Fauci said in a statement Monday. The new study, \"launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\"\nThis vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna Inc. There's no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don't contain the coronavirus itself.\nIt's not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against Covid-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study -- in the US, China and South Korea -- next month.\nThe Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500.\nCovid-19 has upended the world's social and economic fabric since China first identified the virus in January, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, canceling entertainment and sporting events, and encouraging people to stay away from each other.\nStarting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but Jackson described her team's mood as \"subdued.\" They've been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the US struck early and hard by the virus.\nStill , \"going from not even knowing that this virus was out there ... to have any vaccine\" in testing in about two months is unprecedented, Jackson told The AP.\nSome of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice.\n\"We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That's why we're doing a trial,\" Jackson stressed. \"It's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.\"\nMost of the vaccine research under way globally targets a protein aptly named \"spike\" that studs the surface of the new coronavirus and lets it invade human cells. Block that protein and people won't get infected.\nResearchers at the NIH copied the section of the virus' genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. Moderna encased that \"messenger RNA\" into a vaccine.\nThe idea: The body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack -- and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus.\nThat's a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it.\nBut because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned Dr. Nelson Michael of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate.\n\"The science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?\" he told reporters last week.\nThe Seattle research institute is part of a government network of centers that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before Covid-19 began spreading widely in Washington state.\nKaiser Permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and aren't currently sick. Researchers aren't checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of Covid-19 before deciding if they're eligible. If some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, Jackson said. Participants will be paid $100 for each clinic visit in the study. "}, {"content": "Coronavirus. Finland confirms first contagion case with the new coronavirus.

These charges are likely to be waived.\nDemurrage charges are levied by shipping lines on importers when they do not take delivery of the full container and move it out of the port or the terminal area within the permissible number of free days.\nHowever, with China on shutdown mode, many companies are looking at India as an alternative destination.\n\u201cSome 10-12 companies, among those searching for alternatives to China, have spoken to us, and I feel their expectations from us are quite realistic and reasonable,\u201d said Sitharaman.\nThe finance minister is scheduled to meet industry bodies and trade leaders, including those from the tourism sector, about the coronavirus threat on Tuesday.\nShe decided on these interactions after a recent meeting in Chennai, where importers flagged their concerns.\nThe government expects to earn Rs 1.25 trillion from Customs duty in 2019-20, according to Revised Estimates, down 19 per cent from last year\u2019s Budget numbers.\nAjay Sahai, director general and chief executive officer, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said any relaxation in submission of documents for imports purpose would be highly beneficial as statutory agencies have not yet commenced their full operation.\nMeanwhile, officials from finance, commerce and other ministries are also expected to meet stakeholders to find ways on managing the coronavirus fallout.\nFor instance, Principal Economic Advisor Sanjeev Sanyal said he would hold meetings with industry segments over the next week to strategise on overcoming the supply shortage by scaling up domestic production.\n\u201cWe are going to look at ways where we can rework the global supply chain with the help of domestic manufacturers\u2026 We are also talking to other countries. It is a big opportunity for us,\u201d Sanyal told Business Standard.\nTo address the supply crunch, CII has suggested leveraging the existing excess capacity in the Indian industry; rolling back import duty hike to look for alternative sources of imports; expanding credit to manufacturing units with quick loan sanctions, and one-time emergency waiver of non-performing asset regulations for three months.

The reason for the turbulence: The number of infected ones has increased significantly over the weekend over the weekend, in China, the number of dead risen from the virus has risen and South Korea is increasingly affected.\n\"It is clear that the economic consequences of the Corona epidemic will be considerable,\" commented Michael Bissinger, expert at DZ BANK. Damage caused by production losses, disturbed supply chains, limited consumer possibilities and the failures in travel traffic are already considerable for China and the Asian border states.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) already lowered its growth forecognosis for China and, according to UniCredit Chief Volkswirt Erik Nielsen, the country's economy in the first quarter should only grow by 3 percent, after around 6 percent in the end of 2019. Given the most recently increased significance of China's most recently increased significance Global economy will have the corresponding impact on the global economy, so the expert.\nWith regard to Germany, economists of leading German financial institutions assume that the epidemic could delay an economic recovery. Because China is an important trading partner in Germany. For the carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen is the kingdom of the middle of the most important single market. In addition, there are temporary production stops, although BMW and Daimler could now rise their production in China again and Volkswagen announced on Monday to resume the operation of most works.\nIndustry expert Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer expects 2020 compared to the previous year worldwide with a decline in production by 2.7 million vehicles. The German auto industry is particularly affected by the high China share of 35 percent of total sales.\nThe Federal Association of the German Industry (BDI) also warns of the possible impact of the virus on the economy and calls the policy for action. \"In addition to health protection, politics must now focus on economic crisis management,\" said BDI-Chief Managing Director Joachim Lang. \"The Federal Government now has to provide even economic impulses for the revival of growth.\" The more than 5,000 German companies in China are currently limited in procurement, production and sales.\nStopped the production in Chinese factories longer because they remain closed because of the virus, their customers advised in distress. Apple, for example, did not recently conceded its revenue forecast for the current quarter because of supply bottlenecks at iPhones. On Monday, the British mixed corporation from Foods also warned of impact on his textile chain Primark. In Germany, according to BDI, among others, the industries expect electro, automotive, pharmaceutical and paper with bottlenecks for deliveries from Far East.\nAccording to expert, an additional problem is Nielsen that central banks can not respond to such offer shocks. Although the money holders can try to try to boost the charm of companies and consumers, for example with low-cost demand. But there is plain little or nothing to buy, does not use anything.\nIf less is produced, less must be transported. This gets to feel the first logistics companies and airlines. Their shares counted next to the papers of German carmakers for the start of the week to the biggest losers. For the German Leitindex Dax, it went down to almost four percent down to the afternoon. Also in the rest of Europe as well as in Asia, it went downhill and on the US stock exchanges the Dow-Jones stock index lost about three percent to the manual cycle cycle.\nPressures also found papers of the luxury industry, because a large part of sales based on tourists sales. According to a study by the consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the luxury goods industry accounted for the coronavirus with burdens in sales and profit in billions.\nThe economic fears also pressed oil prices. Because the economic activity and the travel activity are braked, the already existing oversupply on the oil market is even greater, explains raw material expert Carsten Fritsch from Commerzbank. On the other hand, the plants applicable as safe ports were in demand. Government bonds increased strongly, their returns fell in return. The gold price rose to a seven-year high, the brand approached 1700 US dollars per ounce (31.1 grams) and achieved in euros even converted a record of 1561 euros.

Or mayhap, complacency has set in. The world\u2019s medical community has, after all, touted the Singaporean government\u2019s rigorous measures against the spread of Covid-19 as the gold standard for keeping the disease in check.

All were thronged with people as if it were 2019 during the Great Singapore Sale, back when we weren\u2019t in the thick of, you know, a pandemic.  \n The government has advised Singaporeans to practise social distancing. What is social distancing, you ask? The idea is to maintain a distance between you and other people \u2014 in this case, at least six feet (about two metres). That also means minimising contact with people, says The New York Times. This is important as there is no vaccine for Covid-19 yet, and social distancing is the only thing that works in lessening the spread of the disease now. China\u2019s drastic drop in new cases within the virus\u2019s epicenter in Wuhan is proof enough that this method has its merits.  \n \u201cI think when you are dealing with an epidemic of a new virus, you are never complacent about it.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday opened the door to a radical shift in the U.S. government's relationship to private industry as the coronavirus outbreak upends the nation's economy, saying he would back the government taking stakes in certain companies.  \n Asked if he supported the federal government moving to take an equity stake in some companies, Trump said: \"I do. I really do.\"  \n Trump, speaking at a news conference at the White House, added: \"We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry.\"  \n The White House did not immediately respond when asked if purchasing shares in battered companies was really under consideration. The U.S. government rarely invests in public companies except in the case of bailouts to save ailing firms and jobs.  \n The COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has sickened more than 11,000 people in the United States and killed more than 180, upending American life as it shutters schools, restaurants and businesses across the country.  \n Bailout requests related to the spread of health crisis, in the form of direct grants, loans, loan guarantees and tax relief, have topped $2 trillion. Companies generally do not welcome government ownership for fear they would lose control of their business, however.  \n  \n PRECEDENT  \n Taking stakes in companies is not without precedent in times of crisis.  \n The Bush and Obama administrations loaned the auto industry, including General Motors and Chrysler, which is now controlled by Italy\u2019s Fiat, $80 billion to avoid the collapse of the industry that they felt would result in the loss of millions of U.S. jobs.  \n The U.S. government spent about $50 billion to bail out GM alone. As a result of the company\u2019s 2009 bankruptcy, the government\u2019s investment was converted to a 61 percent equity stake in the Detroit-based automaker, plus preferred shares and a loan. The government no longer has a stake in the company.  \n Just last month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the United States and its allies should consider taking a \"controlling stake\" in Finland\u2019s Nokia and Sweden\u2019s Ericsson to counter China-based Huawei\u2019s dominance in next-generation 5G wireless technology.  \n The Trump administration accuses Huawei of being able to spy on customers and has led a global campaign to convince allies to keep the blacklisted company out of their 5G networks.  \n Even if the idea of ownership stakes is ultimately discarded, sweeping measures to mitigate the economic fallout from coronavirus seem inevitable.  \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday urged Congress to pass a $1 trillion economic relief measure by early next week, adding the government was focused on being able to provide liquidity to companies.  \n Asked if a trillion dollar stimulus is enough, Trump said: \"We will know about that later. We'll see what happens. It depends how long, so much depend on what's going on in this room, in terms of the medical. If we can stop it in its track the virus, it's plenty.

He did not say how the United States would need to adjust its expectations.\nThe United States wants China to live up to its pledges, Perdue said, but trade negotiators could not have anticipated the outbreak.\n\u201cThere are force majeure type of things ... that I think you have to be sensitive to,\u201d Perdue said.\nThe deal text contains a disaster clause, yet to be formally invoked by Beijing, to allow for delays: \u201cIn the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the Parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other.\u201d\nChina has reported that more than 500 people have died in the outbreak, most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan, where the new virus emerged late last year.\nChina\u2019s ability to meet its purchase target was in doubt even before coronavirus outbreak, because rival soybean supplier Brazil is harvesting a massive crop, and a deadly pig disease is reducing Chinese demand for soy used to feed livestock.\n\u201cIf you will, the coronavirus has given China a get-out-of-jail card on their obligations,\u201d said Bill Lapp, economist and president of Nebraska-based Advanced Economic Solutions.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from the trade deal.

China moved to lock down at least three cities with a combined population of more than 18 million in an unprecedented effort to contain the deadly new virus that has sickened hundreds of people and spread to other parts of the world during the busy Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe open-ended lockdowns are unmatched in size, embracing more people than New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago put together.\nThe train station and airport in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, were shut down, and ferry, subway and bus service was halted. Normally bustling streets, shopping malls, restaurants and other public spaces in the city of 11 million were eerily quiet. Police checked all incoming vehicles but did not close off the roads.\nSimilar measures were being imposed on Friday in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou. In Huanggang, theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment centers were also ordered closed.\nIn the capital, Beijing, major events were canceled indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations, to stop the spread of the virus.\nThe Forbidden City, the palace complex in Beijing that is now a museum, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday.\nChina's National Health Commission said on Friday morning the confirmed cases of the new coronavirus had risen to 830 with 25 deaths.\nThe first death was also confirmed outside the central province of Hubei, where the capital, Wuhan, has been the epicenter of the outbreak.\nThe health commission in Hebei, a northern province bordering Beijing, said an 80-year-old man died after returning from a two-month stay in Wuhan to see relatives.\nThe vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or people with connections the city. Other cases have been confirmed in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore and Vietnam reported their first cases Thursday, and cases have also been confirmed in the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao.\nMany countries are screening travelers from China for symptoms of the virus, which can cause fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and pneumonia.\nThe World Health Organization has decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency, a step that can bring more money and resources to fight a threat but that can also cause trade and travel restrictions and other economic damage, making the decision a politically fraught one.\nThe decision \"should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we're not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said. \"WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.\"\nChinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's Communist Party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics , because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. And the effectiveness of such measures is unclear.\n\"To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\" said Gauden Galea, the WHO?s representative in China. \"It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.\"\nJonathan Ball, a professor of virology at molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said the lockdowns appear to be justified scientifically.\n\"Until there's a better understanding of what the situation is, I think it's not an unreasonable thing to do,\" he said. \"Anything that limits people's travels during an outbreak would obviously work.\"\nBut Ball cautioned that any such quarantine should be strictly time-limited. He added: \"You have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. Otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people.\"\nDuring the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, Sierra Leone imposed a national three-day quarantine as health workers went door to door, searching for hidden cases. Burial teams collecting corpses and people taking the sick to Ebola centers were the only ones allowed to move freely. Frustrated residents complained of food shortages.\nIn China, the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub. Local authorities demanded all residents wear masks in public places and urged civil servants wear them at work.\nAfter the city was closed off Thursday, images showed long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets, as people stocked up. Trucks carrying supplies into the city are not being restricted, although many Chinese recall shortages in the years before the country's recent economic boom.\nAnalysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring.\n\"Even if (cases) are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,\" the WHO's Galea said, adding, however, that the number of infected is not an indicator of the outbreak's severity so long as the death rate remains low.\nThe coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels.\nChina is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of SARS. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts. This time, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasized that as a priority.\nHealth authorities are taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the virus, placing those believed infected in plastic tubes and wheeled boxes, with air passed through filters.\nThe first cases in the Wuhan outbreak were connected to people who worked at or visited a seafood market, now closed for an investigation. Experts suspect that the virus was first transmitted from wild animals but that it may also be mutating. Mutations can make it deadlier or more contagious.

To date there is no vaccine that heals the virus but investigations are already being made in that direction.\nProtecting measures World Health Organization (WHO) recommended some hygiene measures and food security practices to reduce the transmission of the disease, such as:\n\nWash your hands frequently, especially after being in direct contact with people who are sick;\nAvoid unprotected contact with wild animals or fifth;\nAvoid contact close with patients with respiratory infections;\nAdopt respiratory label measures: cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing;\nWash your hands whenever sneezing, coughing or whistling;\n\nWhat to do if it is traveling the World Health Organization does not recommend commercial exchanges for China. If the destination of the trip is the Chinese country, you must follow the recommendations of China's health authorities and the recommendations described by WHO. If, on the other hand, you are returning from affected areas that have symptoms of the disease, should, before you go to a hospital, call SNS24 to report on your health condition and follow the guidelines that are indicated.\nWhat are the world zones affected by the deadly virus? So far cases were recorded in 25 zones of the world.

"}, {"content": "covid-19: critically ill chinese patient saved by stem cell therapy, study says. HONG KONG \u2014 A 65-year-old Chinese woman who fell seriously ill after being infected with the coronavirus made a startling recovery after being given stem cell therapy, according to a new study by Chinese scientists. \n The patient had been fighting for her life in the intensive care unit at Baoshan Hospital in Kunming, the capital of southwest China's Yunnan province, for nearly two weeks after contracting Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. \n But according to a paper published by a team of researchers from Kunming University led by Dr Hu Min, just four days after being given her first shot of umbilical cord stem cells, the woman was back on her feet and able to walk. \n \"Although only one case was shown here, it could be very important and inspire similar clinical practices in treating critically ill Covid-19 patients,\" said the study, which was published on Thursday (Feb 27) on Chinaxiv.org, a platform for the release of scientific papers that have yet to be peer-reviewed. \n The treatment \"might be an ideal choice to be used or combined with other immune modulating agents\", it said. \n The Yunnan case is one of 14 trials using stem cells to treat coronavirus patients in China, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) clinical trial database. While the technology remains controversial, there is hope among health authorities and medical professionals that it could become a lifesaver for critically ill patients. \n The patient in Kunming arrived in the city on Jan 21 on a flight from Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei province and the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. A week later she fell ill with a mild fever, fatigue and coughing, so went to a public hospital where she tested positive for Covid-19. From there she was transferred to Baoshan Hospital. \n Following the strict guidelines laid down by the government for the treatment of coronavirus patients, doctors there first administered antiviral medications and antibiotics, and put the woman\u00a0\u2014 who also suffers from type 2 diabetes\u00a0\u2014 on oxygen to help her breathe. Her condition improved initially but then went rapidly downhill and she was moved to the intensive care unit on Feb 1. \n Things did not improve, and as the woman's health worsened and her organs began to fail, the doctors needed to act fast. So, after consulting the hospital's ethics committee and the patient's family, the stem cell therapy was started on Feb 9. \n Stem cells are highly adaptive early-stage cells that evolve into different types of fully functioning cells to produce tissue, organs or body fluids. The ones used in the Kunming study came from a laboratory culture of umbilical cords from newborn babies. \n The doctors considered using stem cell therapy because Covid-19 has been shown in other studies to cause severe damage to the lungs, liver and other organs. Tests conducted on animals suggested stem cells might be able to repair that damage. \n According to the paper , the Kunming patient was given the first of three shots on Feb 9. After showing no adverse effects to that initial dose she was given a second three days later. On Feb 13, she was able to get out of bed and take a short walk with only limited help. \n She was given her final shot on Feb 15, and two days later was able to leave the intensive care unit and go back to a regular ward. Her vital signs had returned to normal and a throat swab test for Covid-19 came back negative. \n According to Dr Li Honghui, who is involved in similar trials at Loudi Central Hospital in central China's Hunan province, stem cell injections can deliver significant results within three days. \n \"We cannot stick to the rules, we must be bold and innovative,\" he was quoted as saying in a report by Hunan Daily last week. \n Mr Zhang Xinmin, director of biological technology at the Ministry of Science and Technology in Beijing, told a press conference on February 15 that the preliminary results of stem cell experiments conducted across the country suggested the technology was \"safe and effective\". \n Hospitals in Huanggang, one of the worst hit cities in Hubei, received their first shipment of stem cell shots last week and they would be given to three critically ill patients, state media reported. \n Another paper published on Chinaxiv on Friday said that seven coronavirus patients in Beijing had been given stem cell therapy and responded in a similar way to the woman in Kunming. \n Stem cell technology emerged in the 1980s but remains highly controversial. Scientists initially considered using human embryos as the source for the cells, but the idea drew fire on ethical grounds. \n The research community responded by proposing alternative methods for harvesting stem cells, such as turning normal tissue cells into stem cells, but those efforts were tarnished by a series of scandals in the United States, Japan and South Korea involving the fabrication of experimental data. \n In China, scientists are engaged in cutting edge research on stem cells. While the use of cells from healthy embryos is forbidden, scientists are permitted to use fertilised eggs discarded due to illness or defects. \n A doctor treating coronavirus patients in Beijing, who asked not to be named, said there was a growing discussion within the medical community about the potential benefits of stem cell therapy. \n \"The stem cell industry may have some vested interest to promote their technology in this crisis, but if it really works, it should be made available to more patients,\" she said.

The medical impact of the new coronavirus is coming into sharper focus as it continues its spread in what is now officially recognized as a pandemic.\nIts true fatality rate isn't yet known, but it seems 10 times higher than the flu, which kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year, the United States' top infectious disease expert told lawmakers last week.\nMost people have had mild to moderate illness and recovered, but the virus is more serious for those who are older or have other health problems.\nThat's a huge number, said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now heads a global health organization. In the U.S., 60% of adults have at least one underlying health condition and 42% have two or more.\n\"There's still a lot that we don't know\" about the virus and disease it causes, COVID-19, he said.\nHOW IT SPREADS\nMost spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by U.S. scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face.\nThe virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it.\n\"While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,\" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests.\nThe risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but \"one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,\" she said.\nHOW FAST DOES IT SPREAD?\nEach infected person spreads to two or three others on average, researchers estimate. It spreads more easily than flu but less than measles, tuberculosis or some other respiratory diseases. It is not known if it spreads less easily among children, but fewer of them have been diagnosed with the disease. A study of 1,099 patients in China found that 0.9% of the cases were younger than 15.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nMost people get fever and cough, sometimes fatigue or shortness of breath, and recover after about two weeks. About 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, Chinese scientists reported from 45,000 cases there. Symptoms usually start slowly and often worsen as the illness goes on.\nIn a report last week on the first 12 patients in the U.S., seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness.\nIn China , slightly more males have been diagnosed with COVID-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of Chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, Frieden said.\nChildren seem to get less sick -- a report on 10 in China found that fevers tended to be milder and they lacked clear signs of pneumonia.\nWHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?\nSome cruise ship passengers described symptoms similar to the common cold or flu.\n\"It's been a 2 on a scale of 10,\" said Carl Goldman, who was hospitalized in Omaha, Nebraska, after flying home.\nHowever, a Chinese postgraduate student described going to the hospital twice after her symptoms worsened, and feeling \"a heavy head while walking, unable to breathe, and nauseous.\"\nWHAT'S THE TEST LIKE?\nThe CDC recommends at least two swabs -- nose and throat. Samples are sent to labs that look for bits of viral genetic material, which takes roughly 4 to 6 hours. Altogether, it can take several days to ship a sample and get results back.\nIt's been taking two to three days, and \"we are working really hard to see if we can shorten that time\" by developing an in-house test, Dr. Aimee Moulin of the University of California, Davis said Thursday in a conference call held by the American College of Emergency Physicians.\nSome areas have opened drive-thru sites for testing, which could reduce exposure to health workers and other patients or the public.\nWHEN IS THE VIRUS MOST CONTAGIOUS?\nThe average time from exposure to developing symptoms is five to six days, but can be up to two weeks. Tests have found high amounts of virus in the throats and noses of people a couple days before they show symptoms.\nSigns of virus also have been found in stool weeks after patients recover, but that doesn't mean it's capable of causing illness, scientists warn.\n\"The virus can be degraded,\" said Robert Webster, a St. Jude Children's Research Center virus expert. \"It's not necessarily infectious virus at all.\"\nHOW DEADLY IS IT?\nThat won't be known until large studies are done to test big groups of people to see how many have been infected and with or without symptoms.\nScientists have estimated the fatality rate from less than 1% to as high as 4% among cases diagnosed so far, depending on location.\nFlu kills about 0.1% of those it infects, so the new virus seems about 10 times more lethal, the National Institutes of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress last week.\nThe death rate has been higher among people with other health problems -- more than 10% for those with heart disease, for example. In the U.S., 30 million have diabetes, more than 70 million are obese and nearly 80 million have high blood pressure.\nCAN INFECTED PEOPLE WHO RECOVER GET IT AGAIN?\nIt's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place.\nScientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection.\nFauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected.\n\"We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,\" he said. \"Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.\"\nWILL IT GO AWAY IN THE SUMMER?\nFlu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor.\n\"I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,\" Fauci said.\nBut that, too, is far from certain. \"We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief.\nFlu viruses also mutate quickly, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. If the coronavirus follows suit, Frieden said, \"It could become a virus that circulates around the world for many years to come.\" "}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Athletes advised to avoid China if possible.

TOKYO - Two Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan who refused to undergo tests for the new coronavirus have set off a political quandary in Japan over the evacuation mission, with debate centred on how the human rights of a minority should not supersede a potential health menace to society. \n The two, who were among 206 nationals on Japan's first chartered flight out of the epicentre of the 2019-nCOV outbreak which landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Wednesday, had displayed no symptoms at the airport and were \"escorted home\" after refusing to undergo further tests. Their actions came as three new cases of the virus were identified from the evacuees. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had to step in to calm nerves on Thursday (Jan 30). \n \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so,\" Mr Abe told the Diet, as Japan's Parliament is known. \"There are some areas that the government is reluctant to forcefully step in because it encroaches on human rights. But from the second flight we should see how we can properly confirm the health status of all evacuees.\" \n He stressed: \"We will do our utmost to protect the lives and health of the people, and we will make decisions without hesitation.\" \n While the new Wuhan virus has been named a \"designated infectious disease\" in Japan under a special law, it only allows the authorities to make compulsory the hospitalisation of confirmed patients. \n This issue has flared up in Japan, stirring debate among Twitter users, who argue that upholding the human rights of two people should not be more important than averting a potential health menace to society. \n The term \"kensa kyohi\" (rejection of inspection) is trending on the social media platform, with many calling the duo irresponsible and asking for details like where they live so that they can avoid the neighbourhood. Some have gone as far as to say that they should not have been allowed on the chartered flight in the first place. \n Emotions are running high as Japan diagnosed its first cases with no visible flu symptoms on Thursday. These were among the 206 people who returned a day earlier. \n The question, of whether people who have been infected but show no symptoms can still spread the virus, remains unresolved. \n Among the 206, five had been immediately warded upon landing after they reported having a fever and cough. None subsequently tested positive for the Wuhan bug. \n Of the other 199 who had agreed to further tests at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), seven were hospitalised after flu symptoms were confirmed. \n Among these seven, one 2019-nCOV case was found: a man in his 50s who had a runny nose and a sore throat. He subsequently developed a 38.7 deg C fever. \n And among the remaining 191, two cases, a man and a woman in their 40s, had displayed no visible symptoms and were identified only through NIID tests. They have been quarantined. \n Meanwhile, a second chartered flight, carrying 210 Japanese citizens, landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Thursday. Of these, 13\u00a0people who had fever or cough have been hospitalised, public broadcaster NHK reported. Another 300 people who are still stranded in Wuhan want to return to Japan, the Foreign Ministry said. At least one more chartered flight is being planned. \n Further, an Osaka tour guide in her 40s has also tested positive for the 2019-nCOV virus. The tour guide had worked with a previously-identified case - a Japanese bus driver in his 50s who lives in Nara prefecture - in leading a group of tourists from Wuhan from Jan 12 to 17. The group travelled from Narita Airport, to the east of Tokyo, to Kansai International Airport in Osaka. Both cases have no recent travel history to the virus-hit central Chinese city, and the Health Ministry said they were likely infected when travelling with the group of tourists. \n The government is doing urgent contact tracing to identify any people who have come in close contact with the tour group, including in Yamanashi prefecture near Mount Fuji and in Osaka. \n Japan now has a total of 11 confirmed cases of the virus.

It should not be ruled out that a diseased person travel to Germany, Lars Schaade, Vice President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin said.

It is not unusual: \"If you expand monitoring, it is likely that you discover more cases.\"\nThe health authority of the Central Chinese Metropolis Wuhan reported further dead through the novel coronavirus. Overall, six deaths are now confirmed, mostly they concerned older people with severe pre-existing conditions. In addition, dozens of further infections were reported on Tuesday. This now has more than 300 confirmed cases in China since the beginning of the outbreak in December.\nEvidence is also available in Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea - in all cases diseased people who were previously in Wuhan. \"We have to prepare for ourselves in Germany that at least in individual cases, it comes to introductions of the disease,\" said the Berlin Virus Researcher Christian Road. \"Clinics must then be prepared to isolate patients.\"\nThe health risk for the population in Germany is currently classified as \"very low\" by the competent RKI. Although there could be individual cases of imports, continued infection chains - thus subsequent transmissions from man to man - are unlikely to be present, so RKI Vice President Schaade. Even at the Mers-Coronavirus, there were occasional infected in Germany, without it then come to further transfers in Germany.\nThe Federal Ministry of Health also estimates the risk to Germany as low. \"Nevertheless, we observe the situation in China at all attention and are in constant exchange with our international partners,\" said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Health.\nWith the currently running travel wave to the Chinese New Year next Saturday, the risk of spread the virus is growing. In the two-week holiday season around the festival are a few hundred million Chinese traveling, many families companies also joint travel abroad. In addition to destinations in Southeast Asia, traveling to Europe or the USA are also popular.\nAsian neighbors and airports in other countries such as the US and Australia have meanwhile introduced fever controls when entering Wuhan. The Italian Ministry of Health announced to review suspected cases on board in Rome-bound planes from Wuhan in the future. Pilots should therefore report passengers with corresponding symptoms. These would then immediately be brought to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rome , it was said.\nFor the time being, there are no special measures at German airports. However, Frankfurt Airport has made preparations. \"The plan is in the drawer,\" said a spokeswoman for the operator company Fraport on Tuesday. If the health department in Frankfurt exemplifies recommendations, they would be implemented. Direct flights from Wuhan to Frankfurt do not give it any.\nAlso, from D\u00fcsseldorf Airport, it was said, so far, the relevant health care authority does not yet take any action required. If there is a suspicion on board a machine direction D\u00fcsseldorf, the pilot would give an indication of the air traffic control or the airport, a spokesman continued to explain. \"The airport would immediately inform the health department and place the appropriate machine later in a separate area.\"\nFrom the Robert Koch Institute it was said, there was no scientific evidence of the effectiveness of so-called entry screenings at airports, ie controls when entering. It makes sense, however, exit screenings in a disease wave are particularly affected areas. The 11 million metropolis Wuhan has already introduced corresponding controls upon departure.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has convened its emergency committee because of lung disease. The experts should advise on Wednesday. If the WHO exclaims an international health nightstand, she recommends sharply measures to combat the disease. Among other things, border controls and setting up specialized treatment centers can be included.\nCurrently, WHO recommends no travel or trading restrictions. \"On the basis of the existing information, there is no justification for restrictions of travel or trade,\" said the speaker. \"Should the situation escalate, the WHO could comment on the risks of travel in affected areas.\"\nThe EU Commission also plans to make a meeting to assess the risks through the new lung disease. According to a speaker, the Committee on Health Safety should meet on Thursday. Last Friday, there has been an exchange of EU countries, which was advised on possible reactions to the coronavirus.

According to Martin G\u00f6tz, headguide for infectious protection in the health sensor, the seven deaths and 220 confirmed patients in Italy have \"new dynamics in development\". With the crisis staff, the authority wants to equip himself in case the virus designated as Covid-19 also occurs in the Hanseatic city.\nThere is no longer the calm mood than three weeks ago, G\u00f6tz reports from an expert conference on Monday. Representatives of all federal states, the federal government and the Berlin Robert Koch Institute were attended by this. The question was also the question of whether the affected Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto will in future be led as risk regions. There was no decision until the evening, but was considered \"very likely\" by G\u00f6tz as \"very likely\" for the coming days. The slopes of further development in Italy.\nThe Robert Koch Institute has already expanded its recommendations on the risk regions on Monday without calling directly to Italy. There are countries and regions in which individual infection cases have occurred with and without traceability of the infection chains or infection clusters, it is said. With appropriate symptoms and stays in such countries, it is about thinking of Covid-19 as a possible diagnosis.\nHis risk assessment overall has adapted the institute. With an import of other cases to Germany must be expected. Further transfers, infection chains and local infection events in Germany are possible. It should be assumed that it would no longer be able to stop the global spread of the pathogen, even if the health hazards in Germany were currently considered low.\nAgainst this background, G\u00f6tz looks at it as a useful to at least prepare a Bremer crisis rod. This means that the Senate Department as well as fire brigade and police appoint their responsible persons, \"to be able to switch the switch immediately in case of emergency\". The task of a crisis rod is to use the opportunities provided for in the Infection Protection Act in order to prevent further diseases. It is conceivable to close facilities such as schools or kitas or even to declare whole cities as in Italy. What is \"reasonable and relatively\" must be seen, says G\u00f6tz. He reports that the measures in Italy are largely assessed by the German experts as \"exaggerated\". \"The briefing of 20 patients on intensive care units makes us more rigid.\"\nIf it comes to a classification of Italian regions as risk regions, the number of Covid-19 suspected cases in need of clarification is likely to be significantly increased in Bremen. Because unlike China, for example, direct flight connections exist according to Italy. Overall, the travel between Italy and Germany is eight times higher than between Germany and China.\nA concrete suspicion of a disease with the new virus is then when two circumstances come together: on the one hand the clinical symptoms of the disease such as coughing, fever and respiratory distress, on the other hand, the person concerned in the 14 days before either contact with a confirmed Covid 19 patients had or held in a risk area. These are according to the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute so far regions in China, Korea and Iran.\nAccording to Holger Schelb, the family doctors are asked to clinical symptoms and prehistory only clinical symptoms and the history, but no further diagnostics are clarified. \"If a clarification requires case, we would either transfer the patient to the patient in a hospital, depending on the severity of the symptoms, or send them home, with the request to remain there,\" says Schelb. The further investigations point the health department to immediately obtain all the information. Such a process has not occurred according to Schelb so far in Bremen. "}, {"content": "Covid-19.

Such an outcome would be similar to that of the last two pandemics - the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nBoth SARS, in 2003, and MERS, in 2012, which together resulted in over 1,500 deaths worldwide and had infected over 10,000 people globally, had minimal spread and no fatalities in the United States where the disease was met with containment efforts by public health officials.\nThere have been 11 confirmed cases of people carrying the 2019-nCoV in the United States, while 82 more people remain under investigation as of Feb. 3, according to the CDC{here}. More cases of human transmission are expected to surface over the next few days but all those affected are being quarantined and treated.\nLittle detail is now available on the cost of treating the illness and the severity of associated symptoms. Fitch said it will closely monitor the progress of 2019-nCoV, given its rapid transmission.\nLife insurers with a mortality focus would be at greatest risk if the spread accelerates, Fitch said in a separate note.\n\u201cTo-date, 2019-nCoV has not caused any deaths in the U.S. However, any event that might cause an increase in the U.S. mortality rate has the potential to be a negative credit event for U.S. life insurers in a severe scenario,\u201d Donald Thorpe, Senior Director of Insurance Ratings, said in the note.\nThe American Council of Life Insurers maintained that the industry\u2019s capital reserves will help it cope with a potential health crisis with large volumes of claims.

We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe outbreak of coronavirus was declared as a pandemic as the United States stocks plunged into bear market territory and several American cities joined European counterparts in banning large gatherings due to the alarming levels of its spread.\nWHAT IS A PANDEMIC\nA pandemic is a worldwide spread of a disease or an infection. The term is associated with the geographic spread and not any characteristic changes in the infection itself.\nWHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use \"pandemic\" as a descriptive term but added that it does not carry any legal significance. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. The novel coronavirus is not the flu.\nHowever, the term should not be confused with an outbreak and an epidemic.\nHOW IS PANDEMIC DIFFERENT FROM EPIDEMIC\nEpidemic comparatively affects fewer number of people and is confined to a certain region. An outbreak is usually the first stages of an epidemic. An epidemic affects a region or a country and starts infecting a large part of the population.\nThe word epidemic originates from the Greek word 'epidemia' while the word pandemic originates from the word 'pandemos', which denotes \"all people\".\nThe ebola spread was an epidemic that affected western Africa and resulted in the deaths of thousands over some years. The SARS outbreak in China was also an epidemic that killed over 800 people.\nA pandemic is when a disease rapidly starts spreading across the world and is no longer restricted to a community or region.\nThe world has seen a number of pandemics in the past involving diseases such as plague, influenza, yellow fever and others. The latest pandemic is the first caused by coronavirus.\nMore than 118,000 cases of coronavirus have emerged in 114 countries and 4,291 people have died so far.\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industries, markets, bringing flights to a standstill, prompting the latest oil price war, locking down entire nations, closing schools and forcing the postponement of events and concerts across the world.\nThe WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its \"highest level of alarm\", on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of COVID-19 outside China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the casualties and number of infected persons are expected to rise.\nIn the past two weeks the number of cases outside China had risen 13-fold, and the number of countries affected had tripled, a sombre-looking Tedros said, displaying little of his normally upbeat persona.

India's network of trains, the country's lifeblood, has been idled.  \n One train coach has been turned into a prototype quarantine facility, state-owned Indian Railways said in a statement on Saturday.  \n Once they get clearance, the plan is for each of India's railway zones to convert 10 coaches into such wards every week, the company added.

SHANGHAI \u2014 The food market where China's deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. \n The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday (Jan 22) as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed nine people and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. \n Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals \u2014 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat \u2014 setting Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. \n A price list circulating on China's internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game \u2014 112 items in all. \n \"Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,\" said the price list for the vendor, \"Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses\". \n Dr Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licenses, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. \n AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected. \n The Beijing News published a photo Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n VIRUS \u2018SPILLOVER\u2019 \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy \u2014 like the civet or some rats or bats \u2014 or for purported health benefits that are unproven by science. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Dr Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Program. \n Dr Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n \"Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,\" he said. \n \"It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases.\" \n Bats are thought to have spawned Sars, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n Sars was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following Sars, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to Sars, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world.

It is not known whether it is an exception or a rule and how long before the symptoms manifest can be contagious. It is also ignored if, similar to what happened to SARS (English acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome), if there are patients with greater contagion capacity than others.\nIt is also unknown to the highest transmission period and even when it occurs.\nWhat treatments are there?\nCurrently, patients are being treated with support measures, which only treat the symptoms of the disease, such as fever or respiratory difficulty. There is still no specific medicine for this new coronavirus.\nFilipe Froes indicates that there will be ongoing experimental treatments, but its effectiveness is still unknown.\nAccording to the specialist, a vaccine will already be developed, much based on the work that had been made for atypical pneumonia 2002/2003 - SARS.

However , one is not known what the animal that transmitted the virus to the first infected patient, nor if there was an animal that is the originating host and the intermediate host.\nWhat is then known about the new coronavirus?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses living in other animals (eg birds, bats, small mammals) and that in the human being usually cause respiratory diseases, from a common constipation to more severe cases such as pneumonies. They can transmit between animals and people. Most coronavirus strains circulate between animals and do not even infect human beings. In fact, until now, only six coronavirus strains among existing thousands is that they passed the species barrier and reached people.\nThe new coronavirus is from the same family of the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (2002-2003) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (2012).\nThese two types of coronavirus are so far those who have had the capacity to cross the species barrier and to convey to humans and presenting tables of some gravity, explained to the Agency Lusa the pneumologist Filipe Froce.\nThe first cases of 2019-NCOV appeared in mid-December in the Chinese city of Whuan, when they began to reach the hospitals people with a viral pneumonia. It was noticed that all people worked or frequently visited the seafood market and Huanan meats in the same city. The exact origin of infection is still unknown, but they will have been infected animals, which are marketed live, transmit it to human beings.\nThese viruses usually transmit through the respiratory route and mainly affect the respiratory tract, especially the lungs in the serious forms.\nThe symptoms of these coronavirus are more intense than a flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory difficulties.

MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - A pneumonia outbreak in central China widened with more than 200 people now diagnosed with the new Sars-like virus, as health experts said there is now evidence that the illness is spreading from people to people. \n With increased searching and testing for the novel virus among people with symptoms like fever and coughing, the number of cases in China surged over the weekend. Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, now has almost 200 confirmed cases, with three fatalities. Cases were also reported in Beijing and the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. \n Across the region, South Korea detected its first case, according to news agency Yonhap, adding to those found in Thailand and Japan last week. \n The surge in cases, after the World Health Organisation (WHO) released guidance for diagnostic detection of the virus on Friday (Jan 17), confirmed suspicions that the illness is being spread from people to people. There are no reports yet of health-care workers being infected, a sign that the virus is likely not as infectious as Sars, which killed almost 800 people 17 years ago. \n \"It is clear that there is at least some human-to-human transmission from the evidence we have, but we don't have clear evidence that shows the virus has acquired the capacity to transmit among humans easily,\" said Dr Takeshi Kasai, the WHO's regional director for the western pacific, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday. \n \"We need more information to analyse that.\" \n Countries across the world stepped up screening among arriving passengers ahead of the Chinese\u00a0New Year festival that starts this Friday, a period of heightened travel for Chinese people. International airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco started screening from late Friday, joining cities in Asia that implemented the surveillance measure days after the outbreak was reported on Dec\u00a031. \n In Wuhan, health-care workers spread out across the city of 11 million, screening for symptoms among people on planes and at railway stations. \n \"This is a situation where we're going to see additional cases all around the world as folks look for it more,\" Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the US's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Friday. \n \"It's highly plausible that there will be at least a case in the United States, and that's the reason that we're moving forward so quickly with this screening.\" \n It's possible that more than 1,700 people in Wuhan have been infected with the virus, Prof Neil Ferguson and colleagues at Imperial College London said in a study on Friday. Their analysis was based on cases reported outside China last week, with the assumption that it takes five or six days for someone to feel unwell after being infected, and another four or five days for the infection to be detected. \n The widening of cases sparked a rally in Chinese drugmakers' shares on Monday. Antibiotic makers Jiangsu Lianhuan Pharmaceutical Co , Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical Co and Shenzhen Neptunus Bioengineering Co all rose by the 10 per cent daily limit in early trading. \n Shares of companies in the travel and hotel sectors dropped on fears of a hit to tourism over the Lunar New Year, traditionally a peak period of spending for China's billion-strong consumer force. Chinese airlines and Macau casino operators were among the biggest losers on Monday, with Air China Ltd sinking as much as 7.8 per cent in Hong Kong. \n The novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, has triggered alarm because of similarities with the one that sparked Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or Sars, 17 years ago. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people, and others that circulate among animal, including camels, cats, and bats, the CDC said. While rare, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people, and then spread between people. \n The source and transmission routes of the 2019-nCov virus are still unknown, China's National Health Commission said in a statement on Sunday. \n Some of the first group of patients in Wuhan worked or shopped at a seafood market where live animals and wildlife parts were also reportedly sold. \n The closed Huanan seafood wholesale market associated with the Wuhan virus cluster. PHOTO: EPA-EFE \n Provincial health authorities in Guangdong confirmed a case on Sunday in a 66-year-old Shenzhen resident who developed fever and fatigue on Jan 3 during a five-day trip to Wuhan. \n Two cases have been confirmed in Beijing, according to a statement by a local health authority on Monday. The patients, who have a history of travel to Wuhan, have been hospitalised and are in stable condition. \n Officials in Thailand reported two cases last week, while Japan confirmed a case on Thursday. All of them either lived in Wuhan or had spent time there, though none was linked to the seafood market. \n Health authorities said that as of 10pm on Sunday, 25 of the city's 198 cases had been cured. A further three had been discharged from the hospital. Currently, 170 cases are being treated in isolation wards at various hospitals, of which 126 cases are mild, 35 are severe, and nine cases are critically ill. \n Of the 136 patients reported over the weekend, 66 were male and 70 were female; the youngest was 25 years old and the oldest was 89. The most recent illness occurred before Saturday, and initial symptoms were mostly fever, cough or chest tightness, and difficulty breathing. \n Chinese authorities said the outbreak is \"still preventable and controllable\", in an attempt to reassure the public as hundreds of millions of people prepare to travel ahead of the country's biggest annual festivities.

SHANGHAI - Chinese scientists and health experts involved in the country's fight against the coronavirus believe the worst is now over, downplaying warnings that the disease could become seasonal or that a deadlier \"second wave\" could hit later in the year.  \n As the pandemic continues to spread overseas, a growing number of countries are bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario in which COVID-19 remains in circulation until next year at the earliest.  \n But medical advisers in China have expressed confidence that the country's strict containment measures have done enough to ensure that the outbreak can be brought under complete control, domestically at least, within weeks.  \n Though they remain wary of the risks of \"importing\" cases from overseas, they say China should be capable of eliminating COVID-19 in the same way it eliminated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. SARS was eventually contained after the government imposed stringent screening and quarantine measures.  \n \"For me, a second outbreak (of coronavirus), a domestic outbreak in China, wouldn't be a great concern,\" said Cao Wei, deputy director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.  \n She told a briefing on Monday that while China needed another month to make a final judgment, the existing prevention and control measures should be enough to bring the epidemic to an end domestically.  \n The World Health Organization has said the coronavirus reached a peak in China around late February. Zhong Nanshan, a senior government adviser who helped detect and defeat SARS in 2003, said it \"could be over by June\" if other countries take the required action.  \n On Wednesday, there were no new domestic cases in the disease's epicentre of Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began. However, \"imported\" infections reached a record 34, and have outnumbered domestic transmissions for five consecutive days.  \n Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland, said China's actions to contain the virus have been \"extraordinary\" but there could be a second outbreak, this time imported.  \n \"(What) remains possible is that as controls around isolation are relaxed in China, with a population that is still susceptible, then the virus may resurge if it has not been eradicated elsewhere,\" he said.  \n  \n DONE \"99 OUT OF 100\"  \n Gao Zhengliang, vice-director of the China Cell Biology Institute told the official Youth Daily newspaper that the country had now completed \"99 out of 100 steps\" required to defeat the coronavirus, though he warned that if global infections spiralled out of control, \"the costs and sacrifices China has made will be downgraded.\"  \n Some experts have referred to the infection patterns of the devastating 1918-19 influenza epidemic that killed more than 50 million people during three different waves, with the second the deadliest. However, Henderson said it was important to recognise the current virus was different from influenza.  \n Global inter-connectedness means that instead of coming in waves, new viruses are now more likely to spread and circulate until they mutate or until a certain level of immunity is reached. One crucial issue is how long a previously infected patient remains immune.  \n \"The number one point to get across is that in terms of the behaviour of this virus we are still very much in the dark,\" Henderson said. \"The issue around protective immunity is difficult to answer because we simply do not have sufficient information.\"  \n Some experts have raised the possibility that COVID-19 could become an entrenched seasonal illness along with ordinary influenza.  \n Preliminary studies have shown a possible correlation between the epidemic and climate patterns. A paper produced by researchers in Europe this week said the coronavirus preferred cool and dry conditions which could lead to seasonal global outbreaks \"much like other respiratory diseases\".  \n However, there have still been cases in warmer and more humid climates in southeast Asian countries, including Thailand and Singapore.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has been one of many to suggest that COVID-19 could go away of its own accord as temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere.  \n However, Marc Lipsitch, a communicable disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said while warmer and wetter weather could reduce the contagiousness of the coronavirus, \"it is not reasonable to expect those declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.\"  \n Gao of the China Cell Biology Institute said given the higher fatality rate for the coronavirus, relaxing curbs was not an option.  \n \"The resolute curbs on the coronavirus must be continued, it absolutely cannot be allowed to co-exist with humans in the same way as the influenza virus.\" REUTERS "}, {"content": "UPDATE 1-Cargill bans international travel for staff amid coronavirus outbreak.

States adopt strict quarantine rule, roads and shops are deserts.\nThe mysterious pandemic with flu symptoms tears more and more victims in death. MEV-1 is the name of the virus that becomes a global threat in the Hollywood thriller \"Contagion\". Nine years ago, US director Steven Soderbergh brought the catastrophic film with stars like Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard in the cinema.\nThrough the coronavirus crisis, the factually staged thriller suddenly asked greatly in streaming services. What was still gripping in 2011, has a bitter taste. The Covid 19 pandemic with rapid rising number of infected and dead shows more and more parallels with catastrophic scenarios \"Made in Hollywood\". And the coronavirus now teaches the entertainment industry now.\nIronically, Hollywood Darling Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson surprised as the first celebrity couple with the message that they both are infected with SARS COV-2. The entertainment company is quasi-lame. Film and TV productions are stopped, cinema starts worldwide canceled, trade fairs and festivals. Industry experts expect cinema club losses of up to $ 20 billion this year, when the standstill goes over several months.\nThe first burglary came in January with the closure of cinemas in China, the country of origin of the novel virus, at the same time the second largest cinema market to USA and Canada. In February then the preliminary for Tom Cruise and \"Mission: Impossible 7\". For three weeks, director Christopher wanted to turn McQuarrie in Italy, where the virus ruled.\nIt goes on strike on: At the beginning of March, the start of the new James Bond film \"No Time to the\" will be postponed to November by seven months - \"After careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global cinema market,\" says sober justification. Because of the Coronavirus had previously been canceled the entire Advertisingour in China.\nIn the last few days, it meets more blockbusters: \"Fast & Furious 9\", \"The New Muttants\", \"Mulan\", \"Peter Hase 2\", \"A Quiet Place 2\". Fans have to be patient longer until these films come to the cinema. John Krasinski, director of the horror movie \"A Quiet Place 2\", commented on the postponement on Instagram. His movie should be experienced together with other people in the cinema. \"Now obviously is not the right time for it.\" According to China, Italy, Poland and Germany, more and more lighting houses are also tight in other countries.\nIn the US, most cinemas are still open for the time being, but they only give off half of the tickets to make more space and thus more distance between visitors. The Hollywoodstudios set the recommendation \"Social Distancing\", so go on distance to each other to avoid infections , radical around.\nThe Disney Studio announced a massive turntop on Friday, encounters on the set are avoided. Among other things, large projects such as \"The Little Mermaid\", Guillermo del Toros \"Nightmare Alley\" and Ridley Scott's Historiendrama \"The Last Duel\" with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. At the end of February, the shooting for \"Jurassic World: Dominion\" had begun in Hawaii, now the set will be closed until further notice, the Universal Studios announced. For \"The Batman\" came on Saturday the forced break. Warner Bros. wants to interrupt the ongoing shoot in England with main actor Robert Pattinson for at least two weeks.\nAlso, the Netflix streaming service announced, as a precaution, for at least two weeks the production of films and TV shows in the US and Canada.\nThe positive coronavirus test at Tom Hanks had led to the set in Australia for immediate demolition of the new production of director Baz Luhrmann. The Biopic of Studio Warner Bros. is a still title-free movie of film about the Rock'n'Roll Legend Elvis Presley, where Hanks whose manager Colonel Tom Parker plays. The two-time Oscar award winner and his wife had announced the diagnosis on Thursday in the social media. They are now in quarantine and would \"take every day as he comes,\" Hanks emphasized easily.\nIndustry experts in Hollywood meanwhile give a gloomy forecast. They already count up the possible billions losses through the corona crisis. 20 billion dollars could be missing alone at the kinocasses this year, especially when the lucrative foreign markets break down, the film sheet \"Hollywood Reporter\" reported on Friday. In 2019, more than $ 42 billion finished in Hollywood's cash.\nThe annual trade fair Cinemacon is also canceled, where the film theater industry wanted to introduce the latest Hollywood projects at the end of March in Las Vegas. The renowned film festivals Tribeca in New York and the International Film Festival in San Francisco (both planned for April) have been canceled. These are bad harbinges for Cannes, where the 73nd film festivals are in mid-May (still) on the plan. A cancellation would hit the already ailing international industry.

Although it may feel like ages, we are still in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak caused by a new coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0 \n As two old hands who experienced the struggles of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in Singapore, we are gratified to see that preparedness systems are in place here and working well.\u00a0 \n The measures introduced have even been endorsed by infectious disease experts such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\u2019s Professor David Heymann, who noted that despite causing inconveniences, Singapore \u201cis not overdoing it\u201d.\u00a0 \n Nonetheless, a crisis of public confidence is moving faster than the crisis of public health.\u00a0 \n Masks, hand sanitisers and disinfectants were the first to fly off the shelves. Even in our traditionally stoic society, a breach in our psychological defence occurred when some took to hoarding food and household items once Singapore moved to Dorscon Orange on Feb 7.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Can we succeed in beating this virus?\u00a0The answer is most certainly yes, and we are confident of the reasons why.\u00a0 \n UNDERSTANDING OUR INSECURITY\u00a0 \n Insecurity amidst uncertainty is to be expected. Many reports, some untrue, are making their rounds in chat groups, stoking public anxiety, doubt and fear. \n We are sad to see Sars revisited in many ways, with the old unfounded fears of infection prompting members of the public to shun healthcare workers and landlords to throw out tenants who had travelled to China.\u00a0 \n But Covid-19 is much less deadly than Sars or the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). Case-fatality rate measures the number of deaths among those infected and this is now coming out consistently to be much lower for Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0 \n On the other hand, this disease is far more capable of transmitting between humans than Sars or Mers. Transmissibility is measured by its reproduction number\u00a0\u2014\u00a0cases directly generated from each case \u2014 and this is showing to be more like pandemic influenza. \n While social media can be useful, it also means that information can be overstated. Bad news spreads faster than good news. Media, which build in algorithms that prioritise sites similar to those often visited, compound biases in line with previous viewpoints and worsen fear. \n The authorities have been quick to provide timely updates and dispel rumours.\u00a0\u00a0 \n But people have different ways to judge the impact for themselves, with some even contemplating the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d future state, such as Dorscon Red. Hence, expectations and beliefs honed from prior experience and observation of other countries contribute towards behaviours such as panic buying. \n The verdict on this outbreak is not out yet. Much attention is on the effectiveness of control measures in China. \n Some assess that disease incidence will decline into the warmer months of summer. Others believe Covid-19 will last longer, and possibly become endemic in a way similar to influenza.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Whichever the case may be , we can prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.\u00a0 \n Co-author Leo Yee Sin (right) briefing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during\u00a0his visit to NCID on Jan 31, 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0Photo: Raj Nadarajan / TODAY \n WHY WE ARE CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS\u00a0 \n Whether the outbreak lasts weeks or months, halting this outbreak in its tracks ultimately depends not so much on disease duration as on our collective resilience.\u00a0 \n Sustainability is key to preparing for a long battle. Support for each other is crucial to our psychological defence.\u00a0 \n When we recall events of 2003, the immediate impact of Sars was fear.\u00a0But out of this grew one long-lasting positive effect, in the form of a nationwide crash course on the importance of good hygiene practices.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Being a compact city state with a high population density, and dependent on global connectivity for our life blood, we have to accept many hard truths.\u00a0 \n But we are not helpless. There are many actions we can take together to safeguard public health and minimise the impact of acute events that endanger us.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Unwelcome as they are, public health emergencies will occur from time to time and they represent opportunities for us to derive valuable information not just about the disease threat, but also about ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Courageous volunteers are offering their skills and support in the community. Scientists are readily sharing knowledge to address the dearth of understanding on how Covid-19 originates and spreads. \n And we have dedicated healthcare and public health professionals, many with experience from Sars.\u00a0 \n In addition, Singapore's unique size also works in our favour. Many challenges are much more manageable in scale here than they would be in other countries.\u00a0 \n We have ample resources, invested heavily during peacetime. We also have the will to learn from our mistakes and stand together. \n These assets collectively constitute our urban health security.\u00a0Hence, we are confident of success. \n COMMUNITY-BASED RESPONSE VITAL\u00a0 \n New cases are being reported at an alarming rate in many places outside China. As global events unfold, the momentum of this disease is such that we can expect the outbreak (and case-fatality) to get worse before it gets better. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic. \n Just as with Sars, here is a chance for us to improve our community-based response with social norms of self-reliance, solidarity and cooperation. \n With concerns over rapid local spread, we must wash our hands regularly and if we feel unwell, wear a mask and avoid contact with others. We must also be judicious in the use of limited resources.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Inconvenience is inevitable, but we must be patient.\u00a0The virus does not discriminate, and neither must we.\u00a0 \n While we stay geared to fight, our spirits are uplifted by human stories of selflessness. We sense a groundswell of people motivated to strengthen our urban health security. \n Indeed, some of the panic buying ostensibly for one\u2019s own and relatives could be arising from pent-up emotions seeking ways to respond. Perhaps we can harness this for a greater good.\u00a0 \n Acts of kindness \u2014\u00a0people cooperating to give unused masks and hand sanitisers to others, and to cheer on frontline workers with food and messages of love and care \u2014\u00a0nourish our hearts with a warm glow of togetherness. \n The National Centre for Infectious Diseases and Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health have linked up with various groups to address requests on how to mount community-based responses, and clarify any misinformation on the outbreak. \n As the national crisis unfolds on two fronts\u00a0\u2014\u00a0public health and public confidence\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we see an excellent learning moment for all of us.\u00a0 \n The community is proving vital to Team Singapore.\u00a0Hence, connection and engagement with them in one whole-of-society approach should not be ignored. \n Once Singapore ceases its containment efforts and life gets back to a semblance of normality, we may yet be surprised that it happened sooner than we expected. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Associate Professor Ooi Peng Lim is senior consultant with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and teaches field epidemiology at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.

We are only hoping that we come back to India soon.\nAll the buildings around my home are sealed. In fact, a university hostel close to my building has been converted into an isolation ward.\nMy Chinese neighbours are helping me to get food and drinking water.\nI have not spoken face to face with anyone since January 22. There are only nine of us in our building and they all are Chinese.\nLike us, they also stay indoors all the time. The fear is so palpable that no one steps out and talks to one another. Each of us thinks the other is positive for coronavirus.\nThe Chinese government hasn't ordered people not to interact, but the atmosphere of fear lingers heavily all over.\nThe Chinese authorities have asked people not to walk in groups and try to remain solitary.\nThe person who delivers food to us messages on the WeChat app and then at a decided time he drops food at the main gate of our building. We are not allowed to go and pick up the food immediately. After the delivery boy leaves, we are allowed to leave our flat after 30 minutes and pick up our order. This is a rule that everyone has to follow in the university campus.\nThe delivery boy fears we might have coronavirus and we, on the other hand, fear that the delivery boy must be carrying coronavirus so it is a cycle of fear where everyone fears each other. We are keeping a distance from everyone.\nOn January 24, I tried to walk around our campus. I saw a man walking towards me, but suddenly he changed direction, fearing he would contract the virus.\nI don't know how far things have improved in Wuhan. Yesterday, one Chinese news article stated that water in our pipes might be contaminated with coronavirus. I have no idea whether this is true or not. And therefore we have stopped using tap water too. We used to boil tap water and drink, but now we depend on bottled water.\nI have stopped watching the news because I get more worried after watching the news. I don't feel like working too. And even if I call my family back home, how long can I talk?\nI keep fearing the worst every time I feel feverish or sneeze leading to many sleepless nights.\nIf that wasn't enough, when you go to any store to buy medicines for fever, the employees inform the doctors and you are forced to go to hospital for a check-up.\nEarlier, they would check our body temperature every two hours to find out whether I have contracted coronavirus or not; that routine changed to one day a week and now they have stopped that.\nI believe we are in the safe zone now.\nRumour mongering regarding coronavirus is very rampant.\nSome say inhaling dust particles could lead to being tested positive , forcing many to shut their windows. However, how long can one stay in an air-conditioned room?\nWe cannot even dry our clothes as we have to keep all our wet clothes inside the room because we now fear coronavirus might enter through air.\nThe Chinese government is cracking down on people who are spreading rumours and till date 15,000 people have been arrested. The government is trying its best to control rumours, but they refuse to die.\nAnother rumour was that garlic water was a cure for coronavirus. The other was that if one drank whiskey or wine you wouldn't be affected by the virus. This resulted in a rise in sale of whiskey and wine. Soon, there was no whiskey and wine was available in Wuhan.\nI had a miscarriage and returned home on January 22. On that very day, the entire city of Wuhan was shut down.\nI am thankful that I came back on January 22 or else I would have been confined to a hospital which would have been worse.\nThe worst day for me was when the doctors came to our home to check whether we were infected with coronavirus or not. There were 10 of them, all dressed up like astronauts.\nI cried and cried because I felt if I am found positive for coronavirus I would die in China and never see my country again.\nLuckily, I was not positive. And rumours spread so fast on the university campus that we were detected with coronavirus which was untrue.\nThe only way to spend our time is the WeChat group all the Indians staying in Wuhan have formed. We have become friends as we are all in the same boat.\nEvery day we feel the Air India flight will come, but it has not come yet.\nWe have run out of food and we don't have flour. We are only eating rice. There is no bread, butter or jam too.\nWe have stopped eating breakfast and eat lunch at 11 am. In fact, we have stopped enjoying meals and only want to come back to India.\nMy family is worried as they know that the isolation ward has come very close to our home; it is only 20 metres away from our home and it is just a crossing away.\nOur government is trying its best to bring us back.\nWe were told yesterday that we have to keep our belongings packed and ready as the plane could come anytime from India.\nNow we are waiting for that official phone call from the Indian embassy that will finally say that the flight has landed, and to come back home.

In the United States, for instance, Indian imports accounted for 24 percent of medicines and 31 percent of medicine ingredients in 2018, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \n FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told U.S. senators on Tuesday that the agency is working to determine how the restrictions will affect the U.S. medical supply and the effect on essential medicines.  \n The FDA last week announced the first coronavirus-related drug shortage in the United States but declined to name the drug in question. Hahn said on Tuesday that drug was in shortage because of a lack of materials needed to make the API.  \n Indian drugmakers rely on China, the source of the virus outbreak, for almost 70% of the APIs for their medicines.

The council falls under the federal commerce ministry.  \n \"If coronavirus is not contained, then in that case there could be acute shortages,\" Dua said.  \n In a statement, the Indian federal government said state authorities had been asked to monitor the production and availability of APIs and formulations to prevent black marketing and hoarding.  \n U.S. drugmakers have said they are monitoring their supply chains and Mylan NV <MYL.O> warned last week that there could be drug shortages. Eli Lilly and Co <LLY.N> said on Tuesday it does not expect the coronavirus outbreak to result in shortages for any of its therapies, including insulin products.  \n  \n INDIA MONITORING PATIENTS  \n Separately, the Indian government said on Tuesday it had detected \"high viral load\" in six people who had been in contact with a patient who contracted the virus in New Delhi, the capital.  \n The patient in New Delhi was being monitored and was stable, the government said.  \n The six people have been kept in isolation and their samples are being sent to India's National Institute of Virology for confirmation, the government said in a statement https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1604938.  \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to quell public fears.  \n \"There is no need to panic,\" he said in a tweet.  \n \"Had an extensive review regarding preparedness on the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus.

The world is feeling the heat of the pandemic on multiple fronts. It is scampering to rescue humankind from grip of Covid-19 and facing an uphill task of preventing an economic collapse.\nWhile concrete data of loss in businesses and of employment come months later, the sentiment in the markets across the world is gloomy. This is reflected in the frequent crashes in the share markets in all parts of the world.\nThis is the biggest economic crisis in the world since 2008. Some people are already calling it the biggest since 1929-30 economic recession. Unemployment has risen in all affected countries. In the US, data point to biggest jump in people enrolling for unemployment benefits. In India, the worries are similar but there are no concrete data yet to support.\nThe only data reflection is share market. The Sensex is racing to go back to the pre-Modi government level in India. On Monday, the Sensex closed below 26,000-mark. It recorded the biggest-ever single-day fall of 3,934 points closing at 25,981. The Sensex had crossed the 25,000-mark barrier for the first time on the day the Modi government was voted to power in 2014 - on the day of counting.\nIn the past one month, the Sensex has broken record of biggest single-day fall five times. The current season of coronavirus-induced volatility in the share market has wiped off Rs 52 lakh crore of the investors. This is a picture in contrast from the high point on January 13 this year when the Sensex was racing towards 42,000-mark having crossed 41,952.\nThe template is same for all the major economies. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission has enforced four circuit breakers in the Month of March. It is a safeguard that pauses trading for 15 minutes hoping the market will calm.\nCircuit breaker is a tool created in the US after 1987 market crash in which the Dow plunged nearly 23 per cent. Before being enforced four times this month, it had been used only once - during 1997 crash.\nSimilar panic has been seen in the UK, Germany, France and all Asian markets except China, the source country for novel coronavirus pandemic.\nChina's share market benchmark, Shanghai Composite Index (SCE) was at 2,915 on December 12. It was just before the news of novel coronavirus outbreak in China started surfacing. It reached the high point of 3,115 on January 13 and slipped marginally to 3,095 on January 20 when China for the first time officially admitted novel coronavirus outbreak with pressure building from within and outside the country.\nOn January 23, when it closed for Chinese new year holidays, it was trading at 2,976. It saw a major fall on February 3 when it opened after holidays were extended in the wake of novel coronavirus outbreak. Trading was closed before time at 2,746 point.\nInterestingly, China a day earlier had announced infusing liquidity worth of $173 billion into its markets. This kept the sentiments in Chinese markets in good spirit despite increasing cases of novel coronavirus in China through February. The result was the losses in Chinese stock markets were not as severe as outside.\nThe Shanghai Composite on Tuesday stood at 2,722 - not much below the pre-Covid-19 phase. The world has lost hundreds of billions during this phase.\nWhile Indian rupee has been fragile under the impact of novel coronavirus, Chinese yuan or renminbi has remained relatively strong against the US dollar. In the official basket of currencies, yuan has, in fact, climbed more than 4.75 per cent this year, which has been under the shadow of coronavirus pandemic.\nAccording to China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the average daily difference in the US and Chinese 10-year government bond yield is 172 basis points. This means the Chinese assets offers far more attractive returns for an investor.\nSimply put, China seems to be the financially least affected of all countries rocked by novel coronavirus pandemic despite weeks of lockdown. Share market data may not be the ultimate measure of economic impact of Covid-19. However, China is not known to put out adverse data in public. So, true scale of damage may not be known for years.\nThere is another explanation, however, for less volatility seen in China's share markets. Of the tradable share market capitalization in China, foreign capital accounts for less than four per cent. The rest is in the hands of the Chinese government, directly or indirectly.\nThe curve of Chinese stock exchange indices is also curious in the sense that China's was one of the worst-performing share markets before Covid-19 changed the world market outlook.

In the final played in Bangalore, Kolkata Knight Riders won the trophy by chasing down Kings XI Punjab's target of 200 with relative ease.

SINGAPORE \u2014 The Covid-19 outbreak is \u201cstarting to look like a global pandemic everywhere around the world\u201d, at which point it will not be possible to shut Singapore out from the world, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Friday (March 6). \n \u201cWhat we might do, even when (the disease) becomes more prevalent around the world, is to maintain some level of surveillance as we are doing today at the checkpoints to pick out and identify people with symptoms. \n \u201cThat might still be one level of control that we can do at the borders, but beyond that, we do need to do more within our own community in Singapore to slow the spread of the virus,\u201d said Mr Wong at a press conference by the Multi-Ministry Task Force that is tackling the virus outbreak, which he co-chairs. \n Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who also co-chairs the taskforce; Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli; and MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak were also present at the conference held at the National Press Centre. \n Mr Wong was addressing a question about the continued relevance of border controls and travel restrictions, following fresh measures issued on Tuesday to bar the entry of foreign visitors with recent travel history to Iran, northern Italy and South Korea, which have been identified as epidemic centres for the disease outside China. \n \u201cYou have got to look at two categories: (The first) are the countries that we have already put in place travel restrictions, because we have identified these to be epidemic centres, starting with China and later expanded to a few other countries. To the extent that these countries take effective containment measures... then at some point in time, I think border controls to these countries will no longer be so relevant,\u201d he said, referring to China and South Korea. \n Mr Wong said China has been working hard to contain the virus and the number of new cases have gone down, while South Korea is taking proactive testing measures and is also vigilant in containing the spread to other cities. \n When deciding on whether to lift travel restrictions on these visitors, Singapore will consider \u201cif the situation within these countries is clearly very well contained\u201d and look at other data and evidence. \n The second part is whether to impose new border control measures, such as travel restrictions, targeting new epidemic centres of Covid-19, he said. \n \u201cI will not rule it out at this stage, but if you think and project ahead, and indeed if the virus is spreading and not that we have one clear epidemic centre and there are epidemics all around the world and it becomes a global pandemic, then there is no basis for putting together border controls unless we shut ourselves, which we don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said. \n Whether Singapore decides to impose these new bans depends on the evolving situation and the usefulness of such restrictions , added Mr Wong. \n \u201cAt that stage, the bigger risk is not importation of cases from these countries, but the importation of cases from countries that may not have travel restrictions\u2026 We are now seeing more cases coming from Europe, we are starting to see more cases in America, so it is starting to look like a global pandemic everywhere in the world,\u201d he said. \n Addressing a question on whether lifting these measures at a time when Singapore deems fit to do so would inadvertently cause a surge of visitors from places previously seen as high-risk, Mr Gan said it was important not to see Singapore\u2019s approach to border controls in a \u201cbinary way\u201d, since its actions have been incremental. \n This is evident in how Singapore has gradually ramped up its restrictions from Wuhan - where Covid-19 was first reported - to Hubei province and then to the rest of mainland China, he said. \n Mr Gan also noted how at the checkpoints, Singapore first rolled out temperature screening measures, and later increasing these measures to also conduct swab tests at the borders. \n \u201cEven for countries that we have border controls, we may adjust incrementally so it doesn\u2019t mean that if we open the floodgates (by lowering travel restrictions), everybody will come in overnight,\u201d said Mr Gan. \n He urged Singaporeans to keep up on personal hygiene efforts, emphasising the critical importance of the new SG Clean campaign launched earlier last month. \n A new taskforce, headed by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, was announced Friday (March 6) to encourage good personal hygiene, adjust social norms and raise cleaning standards across the country. \n Mr Gan said besides measures such as border controls, the SG Clean campaign is in fact Singapore\u2019s first line of defence. \n He said: \u201cWhether we have temperature screening or swab tests, it is not a hundred per cent. Even if we have restrictions on travel (from certain countries), we will also have Singaporeans coming back and we can\u2019t stop them from returning to Singapore. \n \u201cTherefore, personal hygiene and public health standards are the most important (moves) and that is why we need to push ahead with SG Clean,\u201d he said. \n GLOBAL PANDEMIC AN \u2018EMOTIVE\u2019 TERM \n The World Health Organization (WHO), although avoiding any reference to Covid-19 as a pandemic so far, has nevertheless called upon the world to be prepared for one. \n It currently refers to Covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. A pandemic, according to WHO definitions, refers to \u201cthe worldwide spread of a new disease\u201d. \n In a separate interview following the press conference, MOH\u2019s Associate Professor Mak was asked if Singapore would be making representations to the WHO on calling Covid-19 a pandemic. \n Dr Mak said the use of the term carries highly emotive overtones, as well as the notion that countries or continents have failed to control the spread of infections within their borders. \n \u201cAs the WHO has said, there is significant potential for a pandemic to arise, but we may not have reached a stage where individual countries and their local efforts to contain it have failed,\u201d said Dr Mak. He added that it is perhaps more helpful to look at how individual countries are stepping up efforts to control the spread of the virus, and how viruses transmits from one country to another. \n On its part, Singapore is collaborating and sharing best practices to tackle Covid-19 with other countries, he said. There is also the possibility to coordinate national strategies across borders on how to respond to the virus\u00a0\u2014 the health ministries of Malaysia and Singapore have formed a joint working committee to fight Covid-19, for example. \n \u201cThese are areas that we continue to look at seriously and we continue to be in discussion with international health authorities, our sister (agencies) in the region and further out, to see how we can share information and align our measures,\u201d he said.

The Bundeswehr has placed more than 100 Germans after their return from the Chinese city of Wuhan in a barrack in the southern Germersheim. They had landed on Saturday night with a Bundeswehr machine in Frankfurt am Main and brought with several buses to the training location of the Air Force, which now serves as a quarantine station. There, the returnees should remain at least two weeks under medical supervision. So you want to ensure that the Coronavirus broken out about one month ago in China does not continue. In addition to the Germans were also 22 Chinese, an American and a romanian aboard the machine.\nEleven the total of 124 passengers had been brought after a study at the airport to the Frankfurt University Clinic - among them a patient in which doctors can not exclude a coronavirus disease. In the remaining ten other medical reasons, Hesse's social minister Kai Klose said. The authorities stressed, the risk to the population was low.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example.\nIn China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever , Cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help.\nMeanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThat can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS.\nSo far, nine Germans have infected with the novel virus. In Bavaria, the Ministry of Health reported an eighth illness on Saturday, while Spain announced, a German tourist has become infected with the Coronavirus. The coronavirus has an incubation period of\nup to two weeks, in\nwho do not have any symptoms yet. Nevertheless, an infection may be available.\nThe return flight of the Germans from Wuhan dissolved diplomatic tensions with Russia. The Bundeswehrmaschine had originally to be intermediate in Moscow. For this, Russian aviation authorities had also placed a landing permit. In the end, however, Russia denied the intermediate landing and this is due to the fact that the airport has capacity bottlenecks, said Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU).

The health commission in Beijing reported an increase of almost 2,000 new diseases and 45 dead. According to the authority, a total of 304 people in the People's Republic died at the respiratory disease. More than 13,700 people have infected themselves throughout China. The 45 new dead come from the particularly strongly affected province Hubei.\nFrom Wuhan, the virus has spread in 24 other countries. As the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Sunday, in the Philippine capital Manila died for the first time an infected outside of China. It is a Chinese from Wuhan.\nGiven the emergency situation, the European Union has sent twelve tons protective clothing to China.

It's very harmful,\" Mr Cui said in the interview that aired on Sunday (March 22). \n \"Eventually, we must have an answer to where the virus originally came from. But, this is the job for the scientists to do, not for diplomats.\" \n Mr Cui's comments represent a sharp public rebuke to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who has publicly questioned whether the virus originated in China and even touted the idea that it may have been introduced by US Army athletes. \n Such public differences are rare among Chinese officials, who are famous for their ability to stick closely to the Communist Party's official line. \n Mr Cui is appointed directly by President Xi Jinping and holds a vice-ministerial rank in China's political hierarchy. \n That makes him two levels senior to Mr Zhao, whose official title is deputy director of the foreign ministry's Information Department. \n Mr Zhao continued to promote the theory on Sunday, retweeting speculation from a Twitter user who goes by the name \"the lizard king\" that Covid-19 has been around in America \"for a while\". \n The user is described as an \"fl transplant to the desert\", a \"mama\" and \"not an expert\". \n The ministry spokesman's statements have been echoed in official state media in recent days and have provoked anger in Washington. \n President Donald Trump has taken to calling the pathogen the \"Chinese virus\" and has blamed the US's outbreak on the Asian country's early failures to control the disease. \n \"As you know China tried to say at one point -- maybe they stopped now -- that it was caused by American soldiers,\" Mr Trump told reporters March 18. \"That can't happen. It's not going to happen, not as long as I'm president. It comes from China.\" \n Meanwhile, China has also found itself in a tit-for-tat with the Trump administration over foreign journalists in Beijing. \n Last week, authorities in the foreign ministry expelled at least 13 American journalists from Beijing and forced at least seven Chinese nationals to stop working for American news outlets there. \n Asked by Axios about Mr Zhao's comments, Mr Cui referred the question back to the spokesman and his authority as ambassador to speak on behalf of the Chinese government. \n \"Maybe you could go and ask him,\" Mr Cui said. \"I'm here representing my head of the state and my government.\" "}, {"content": "Coronavirus pandemic: First death reported in Pakistan, cases mount to 193.

(Reuters) - The coronavirus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.\nA Feb. 7-13 Reuters poll of 40 economists based in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, as well as Europe and the United States, predicted China\u2019s annual economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 to slump to 4.5% from 6.0% in the previous quarter.\nThat drop was expected to drag down the full-year growth rate in 2020 to 5.5% from 6.1% in 2019, its weakest since at least 1990 when comparable records began.\nHowever, economists were optimistic the economy would bounce back as soon as the second quarter, with growth then forecast to recover to a median 5.7%, according to the poll.\nThat figure was pushed higher by several optimistic forecasts from economists based in mainland China. The range was 2.9%-6.5%.\nThe coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan - a nerve center in the global supply chain with a population of just under 11 million - and so far has claimed over 1,300 lives in China. That outstrips fatalities from the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 which killed 774 people worldwide.\n\u201cNobody knows the damage China\u2019s virus containment efforts will have on growth, and we probably never will for sure, given the opacity of the statistics. We reckon true GDP growth will fall below 2% in Q1, from 4.0% in Q4, which already was substantially lower than the official 6.0%,\u201d said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon in London.\n\u201cThe lost production probably will be made up over the remainder of this year.

However, in the worst-case scenario, growth may fall to 2-3% in the first quarter and to 5% in (full-year) 2020,\u201d said Bingnan Ye, senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of China International in Beijing.\nTheir 2020 forecast matched the median worst-case outcome and lined up with the Chinese government\u2019s forecast for the full-year economic growth rate to fall as much as 1 percentage point in 2020.\n\u201cWe do not expect a speedy recovery for the economy, even in the unlikely event that there are no new confirmed cases. After the coronavirus has been contained, it may still take four quarters to see a full recovery,\u201d said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.\n\u201cCompared to 2003\u2019s SARS, this is a lot more damaging.\u201d\nSince then, China\u2019s economic composition has changed significantly to become a more consumption and service-driven economy from being the world\u2019s factory before.\nChina\u2019s share of the global economy has quadrupled to 16% since the SARS outbreak, so any major disruption to economic activity is likely to have a bigger impact on the world economy now.\n\u201cEvery day is a deadline in February as Wuhan coronavirus data roll in,\u201d noted Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, the most accurate forecaster for Asian currencies in 2019. \u201cFor the yuan, the overall depreciation story continues.\u201d\n(Reuters poll graphic on China economic outlook - here) "}, {"content": "What we need to know about the Chinese virus Unnamed: Risks, care and how Portugal is prepared. The news of the appearance of a new virus in a fish and seafood market in Wuhan, a city in the center of China, caused an international alarm. There are still fresh memories about SARS and MERS, two other coronaviruses. Both emerged already in the present century, provoked a large number of deaths before finally being controlled. The new virus, which for now has no name but causes family symptoms such as fever and breathing difficulties and has led to dozens of pneumonias, does not seem to have the same potential to kill. Of the infected persons already confirmed, one died and was someone who was already seriously weakened by other diseases. In more than 700 people who have had contact with patients, including health professionals, none seems to have been contaminated. However, the possibility of limited transmission within families is not discarded and this week the World Health Organization has warned hospitals from all over the world that the new virus can spread - a fear enhanced by the enormous displacement of people who will accompany the Chinese New Year Celebrations until January 25. In Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health mentioned this Wednesday that there are no reasons for alarm. The Expresso spoke with Raquel Guiomar, who recommends: \"Whenever someone addresses a hospital or a medical office and has a respiratory infection, he should refer to a recent journey, namely China, where the cases of this virus were identified.\"\nWhat measures are being taken by the Ricardo Jorge Institute to face the potential threat of this virus? At the level of laboratory diagnosis, which is the mission of this institute, we are following all the indications given by international networks, in particular by the World Health Organization, and we are establishing specific laboratory diagnosis for this coronavirus. The recommended diagnosis by WHO has been released Tuesday and we are implementing it to quickly become available. In addition to the diagnosis, we are following other WHO guidelines. In all suspected cases, and having a connection with the origin of the outbreak, China, these patients and their products will be tested for the most common viral agents that are associated with respiratory infections - and which the Institute has a vast number of Diagnoses, namely influenza, other human coronaviruses, adenovirus for influenza, and also coronaviruses that were associated with outbreaks in the early two years and now more recently, especially Mers and SARS Coronavirus. In all these suspicious cases it is also recommended to do a search for bacterial respiratory agents and even other agents such as opportunistic fungi. It will be this, therefore, follow-up. The Institute has also implemented a methodology that allows the genome or bacteria either from viruses and fungi in biological samples and will allow it to identify this new virus.\nWhat symptoms can, lead a person to draw attention as an eventual bearer of the new virus? What has been recommended, not only to clinicians, but also to the patients, is that whenever someone addresses a hospital or a medical office and has a respiratory infection, should refer to a recent journey, namely to China, where the cases of this virus were identified. And, as was done in the suspected cases of Mers Coronavirus, it must be ensured that until the confirmation of the laboratory diagnosis - as a negative or positive case - the patient is in insulation conditions. This evaluation is done by the Directorate-General for Health and by the doctors who have this function. The first information gave news that it had not yet been confirmed that the virus could be transmitted among humans. However, there was the case of that person who did not go through the market in Wuhan, where the outbreak will have begun, and yet he contracted the virus. How human can human transmission exist?

CAPE TOWN - South African president Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster on Sunday as he announced a range of measures to contain a COVID-19 outbreak that has so far infected 61 and showed the first signs of internal transmission.  \n In a live television broadcast after a special cabinet meeting, Ramaphosa said the outbreak, first detected on March 5, could have a significant and \"potentially lasting\" impact on a struggling economy, which is already in recession.  \n Measures to be taken include travel bans to countries such as Italy, Germany, China and the United States. The government will also prohibit gatherings of more than 100 people and cancel large events and celebrations, he said.  \n \"It is concerning we are now dealing with internal transmission of the virus.

On Sunday, one of South Africa's top universities, Wits in the economic heartland Gauteng, instructed 350 students to immediately self-quarantine for two weeks after a classmate tested positive for COVID-19.  \n Besides the health impacts, Ramaphosa said the economy would not be spared as exports decline in key markets, including China, and the labour-intensive tourism sector suffers.  \n \"Cabinet is therefore in the process of finalising a comprehensive package of interventions to mitigate the expected impact of COVID-19 on the economy,\" he said. REUTERS "}, {"content": "China virus outbreak may wallop economy, financial markets. BANGKOK (AP) \u2013 News that a new virus that has afflicted hundreds of people in central China can spread between humans has rattled financial markets and raised concern it might wallop the economy just as it might be regaining momentum.Health authorities across Asia have been stepping up surveillance and other precautions to prevent a repeat of the disruptions and deaths during the 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis, which caused USD40 billion-USD50 billion in losses from reduced travel and spending.The first cases of what has been identified as a novel coronavirus were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting animal-to-human transmission, but it now is also thought to be spread between people. As of yesterday, some 440 people were confirmed infected and nine had died from the illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms.A retreat in financial markets on Tuesday was followed by a rebound yesterday, as investors snapped up bargains. Share benchmarks were mostly higher, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gaining 1.1 per cent and the Shanghai Composite index advancing 0.4 per cent. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 0.7 per cent.While the new virus appears much less dangerous than SARS, \u201cthe most significant Asia risk could lie ahead as the regional peak travel season takes hold, which could multiply the disease diffusion,\u201d said Chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp Stephen Innes. \u201cSo, while the risk is returning to the market, the lights might not turn green until we move through the Lunar New Year travel season to better gauge the coronavirus dispersion.\u201dThe 2003 outbreak of SARS in China, along with cases of a deadly form of bird flu, resulted in widespread quarantine measures in many Chinese cities and in Hong Kong. More than 8,000 people fell sick and just under 800 people died, a mortality rate of under 10 per cent.While the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, such new diseases raise alarm due to the uncertainties over how deadly they might be and how they might spread. That\u2019s especially true during the annual mass travel of the Lunar New Year festival, which begins this week.\u201cThe cost to the global economy can be quite staggering in negative GDP terms if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,\u201d Innes said in a report.In China, health officials stepped up screening for fevers. \u201cWe ask the public to avoid crowds and minimise the public gatherings to reduce the possibility of cross infection,\u201d Deputy Director of the National Health Commission Li Bin said yesterday. Just as with SARS, though, the impact of the disease is likely to fall heaviest on specific industries, such as hotels and airlines, railways and other leisure businesses and retailers, analysts said. Most declined on Tuesday but rebounded yesterday as investors locked in profits ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. The outbreak is a boon , meanwhile, for pharmaceutical companies and makers of protective masks and other medical gear.\u201cIf the pneumonia couldn\u2019t be contained in the short term, we expect China\u2019s retail sales, tourism, hotel and catering, travel activities likely to be hit, especially in the first and second quarters,\u201d said Ning Zhang of UBS. Government efforts to offset the shock would help, but growth will likely rebound less than earlier forecast, Zhang said.As of January 17, the World Health Organization (WHO) had not recommended any international restrictions on travel but urged local authorities to work with the travel industry to help prevent the disease from spreading while warning travellers who fall ill to seek medical attention.The illness is yet another blow for Hong Kong, whose economy is reeling from months of often violent anti-government protests. The wider concern is China, where the economy grew at a 30-year low 6.1 per cent annual pace in 2019. An interim trade pact between Beijing and Washington had raised hopes that some pressure from tensions between the two biggest economies might ease, and the latest data have showed signs of improved demand for exports. The virus outbreak raises the risk such optimism might be premature.\u201cAccording to our analysis of the spread of the SARS virus, which so far appears very similar to 2019-nCoV (the new virus), we expect increased downward pressure on China\u2019s growth, particularly in the services sector,\u201d Ting Lu and other analysts at Nomura in Hong Kong said in a commentary.The growing number of global travellers has contributed to the spread of various diseases in recent years, including Middle East respiratory syndrome, the Ebola and Zika viruses, the plague, measles and other highly contagious illnesses.The World Economic Forum estimates that pandemics \u2014 cross-border outbreaks like the flu that killed 50 million people a century ago \u2014 have the potential to cause a USD570 billion in annual economic losses.The 2014-16 Ebola virus epidemic caused losses amounting to over USD2.2 billion, according to the World Bank. That includes a 40 per cent decrease in the number of working Liberians at the height of the crisis, lower exports and harvests, and costs for combating the disease.

US owe us an explanation!\" Zhao tweeted on Thursday with a video clip of the CDC director's comments.\nHe, however, did not elaborate his allegation against the US army.\nOn March 5, Zhao told a media briefing that the origin of the virus is yet to be determined, raising question over reports that the virus had originated from a live animals market in Wuhan in December.\n\"It is yet undetermined where the virus originated. Wherever its origin may be, China and all the other affected countries are victims faced with the challenge in containing its spread,\" Zhao said.\nAsked on Thursday at a media briefing here whether China has proof that the coronavirus didn't originate in China and if so, where did it originate, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said the \"origin of the virus can only be determined by science. We need to rely on scientific and professional views. We don't hope to see anyone making an issue out of this to stigmatise other countries.\"\n\"With COVID-19 developing into a pandemic, the world should come together to fight it instead of levelling accusations and attacks against each other, which is not constructive at all,\" Geng said.\nWhen asked about US President Donald Trump's televised speech on Thursday in which he said that coronavirus started in China and spread to other places, Geng said China has been \"acting in an open, transparent and highly responsible way since the outbreak of the epidemic\".\n\"We have taken the most comprehensive, rigorous and thorough measures in this all-out, people's war against the epidemic.

Cases have been detected as far away as the United States.\nContrasting with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people, China\u2019s communist government has this time given regular updates to try to avoid panic as millions travel for the Lunar New Year.\nAfter a meeting at its Geneva headquarters on Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it would decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which would step up the international response.\nIf it does so, it will be the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade.\n\u201cThis is an evolving and complex situation,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nAs it seeks to stop the spread of the virus, Wuhan\u2019s local government said it would close all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from the city as of 10 a.m. on Thursday (0200 GMT), state media reported, adding that the government said citizens should not leave the city unless there were special circumstances.\nThe measure was intended to \u201ceffectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the health and safety of the people,\u201d state media cited Wuhan\u2019s virus task-force as saying.\nWuhan\u2019s move was praised by Ghebreyesus as a \u201cvery strong\u201d measure that could minimize the risk of contagion.\n\u201cIf Wuhan is taking such drastic measures, we must assume widespread community transmission in this central China megacity & transport hub,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington, wrote in a tweet.\nWith more than 11 million people, Wuhan is central China\u2019s main industrial and commercial center, home to the country\u2019s largest inland port and gateway to its Three Gorges hydroelectric dam.\nThe latest death toll in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, rose to 17 by midday on Wednesday, state television quoted the provincial government as saying.\nHowever, the virus has already spread beyond the city to population centers including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong.\nThe official China Daily newspaper said 544 cases had now been confirmed in the country. Thailand has confirmed four cases, while the United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have each reported one.\nBritain advised its citizens against all but essential travel to Wuhan.\nMany Chinese were canceling trips, buying face masks, avoiding public places such as cinemas and shopping centers , and even turning to an online plague simulation game as a way to cope.\n\u201cThe best way to conquer fear is to confront fear,\u201d said one commentator on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo.\nChina\u2019s National Health Commission Vice Minister Li Bin said the virus, which can cause pneumonia and has no effective vaccine, was being spread via breathing.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been at the forefront in fighting this health crisis under the leadership of its Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Since December 31, 2019, when WHO was first informed about pneumonia cases in Wuhan emanating from \"unknown causes\", the WHO has been actively monitoring the situation and holding consultations at different levels.\nThese include declaring the outbreak an international health emergency, mobilising the international scientific community to come together to fight coronavirus, and issuing safety precautions and guidelines for general public, businesses, governments, hospitals and other stakeholders, among other measures.\nAs WHO chief, Dr Ghebreyesus flew in to China to meet President Xi Jinping, and a WHO team comprising of international health experts is already operating in China. Dr Ghebreyesus has also been interacting with world leaders, spearheading calls for research collaborations and raising funds to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.\nBut these efforts by the WHO in the face of a global health emergency, about which very little is known, seem to be of little consideration for a section of society that has unleashed a brutal attack against Dr Ghebreyesus on social media.\nThe attack is not only personal in nature, but also seeks to tarnish his professional image by questioning his credentials and commitment.\n'CHINA'S LAP DOG'\nDr Ghebreyesus has been accused of conspiring with China in its \"propaganda\" to hush-up coronavirus cases. Many have gone on to call him \"China's lap dog\", say he is \"irresponsible and coward\", and accuse him of \"jeopardising the world for his private profit\", among other charges.\nThe WHO chief's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his tweets praising the country's leadership for its \"determination to end the new coronavirus outbreak\" too have not gone down well with many social media users.\nThe petition blames Dr Ghebreyesus for the rising coronavirus cases and resultant deaths, and says this is partly because of his underestimation of the outbreak.\n\"We strongly think he is not fit for his role as WHO Director General. We call for the immediate resignation of Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. A lot of us are really disappointed. We believe WHO is supposed to be politically neutral,\" the petition reads. Its comment section, where people mention why they are signing the petition, is filled with derogatory remarks that are unmentionable.\nIn short, Dr Ghebreyesus is being hounded online on two counts:\nMISPLACED ANGER\nPeople's concerns and anxiety about the coronavirus outbreak are understandable but that cannot be an excuse to malign the WHO or its chief. In times of an epidemic of this magnitude, people, irrespective of national boundaries and political leanings, need to stand united and support individuals and organisations that are working on ground to tackle the crisis.\nHurling personal attacks on individuals leading such efforts doesn't help improve the situation , but rather often proves to be counterproductive. It infuses negativity in public discourse, which in turn tends to cast aspersions on genuine efforts--a breeding ground for suspicion and misinformation.\nSecondly, one may have a hundred differences with China and what its political system and leadership stands for. But is this really the time to attack and malign the nation?\nBefore attacking Dr Ghebreyesus for meeting President Xi Jinping and praising his government's efforts against coronavirus, one must realise that besides leading an international health organisation in the midst of an epidemic, Dr Ghebreyesus also has to negotiate various diplomatic hurdles in forging an international coalition against the epidemic. With regards to coronavirus, this global effort is simply impossible if China is not on board.\nFaced with such a sensitive situation, the WHO chief cannot afford to upset the Chinese leadership, even if there are some shortcomings on ground. A confrontational approach against President Xi Jinping is likely to snowball and prove futile when it comes to controlling the situation.\nThose who are calling Dr Ghebreyesus names and demanding his resignation must answer if they think China would have allowed a WHO team comprising international health experts to visit coronavirus-hit regions and investigate the situation had the health body's chief confronted President Xi and talked bitter about him.\nThe reality today is that thousands of people are suffering in China. Many have died and many more are likely to die in the coming days. Priority for the global community right now should be to control the situation, not to embroil itself in mudslinging and waste its energy by pointing fingers in a show of one-upmanship. Investigations into who and what went wrong (if at all) can wait. Saving lives can't.\nDr Ghebreyesus's success in convincing China to allow a team of international health experts to visit coronavirus-affected regions is nothing short of a major diplomatic success. If at all China deliberately hid facts or underreported the situation, as is alleged, it will be known to the world in due course when these international experts document their observations.\nWhy do we have to jump into conclusions without any evidence and tarnish the image of hardworking health workers who have been slogging day in out treating patients? Those leading the vitriol online attack against the WHO and its chief must answer if slander, malice and a hatred-filled anti-China campaign is how these tireless medicos deserve to be treated with for their services.\nThe other reason why the WHO and Dr Ghebreyesus are being attacked stems from the argument that Dr Ghebreyesus didn't declare coronavirus outbreak an international health emergency at an earlier date.\nThose forwarding this argument must understand that decisions to declare an international emergency cannot be based on one person's whims and fancies. Far from being a one-person show, it involves rigorous assessments and deliberations between various stakeholders, all of which takes time. Even before declaring it an international health emergency, the WHO had been rigorously following up on research and treatment of coronavirus patients in China.\nHowever, none of this means China, the WHO or Dr Ghebreyesus are above questioning. One must question them by all means, but personal attacks and a campaign aimed at tarnishing individuals and maligning an entire country is definitely not the way to do so.

HANOI/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Cambodia has agreed to let a cruise ship that has been turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard may have the coronavirus dock and disembark its passengers, the Holland America Line said on Wednesday.\nFor nearly two weeks, the MS Westerdam, a ship of healthy passengers, had been sailing throughout Asia after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines over fears that someone on the cruise could have the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 1,100 people, almost all of them in China.\n\u201cWe will immediately begin making our way to Sihanoukville in Cambodia,\u201d Westerdam captain Vincent Smit told passengers, according to a recording of the announcement reviewed by Reuters.\n\u201cThere will be a brief health inspection on board by the Cambodian authorities which will take place at anchor just before we arrive alongside,\u201d said Smit.\nThe ship is expected to arrive in Cambodia around 7 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Thursday, he said.\nThe latest country to shun the ship, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew on board, had been Thailand, where the health minister refused to grant the Westerdam permission to dock.\n\u201cThe staff has tried to bolster spirits but you can only play so many games of trivia,\u201d Angela Jones, a business consultant from the U.S. state of Georgia, told Reuters in a video recording sent before the news that Cambodia would take the ship. \u201cI\u2019ve asked others who say they are napping a lot.\u201d\nLike many on board, Jones had embarked in Hong Kong for a much-anticipated cruise through the region in early February. It was scheduled to be a two-week cruise, but with that period running out this week, there had been worries about fuel and food supplies. Many on board are elderly and there was also concerns they could be running out of medicines.\nTo kill time and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship\u2019s crew have organised dozens of activities to keep people occupied, tourists on board the vessel told Reuters.\nPeople could be seen playing chess and doing puzzles on Wednesday, in some of the first pictures published by media of life aboard the ship.\nOther activities on offer included colouring-in for adults; teeth whitening; poker tournaments; whisky tasting; even a lecture on modern China which delved into the economics of collective farming, according to passengers on board and a copy of the ship\u2019s activity programme seen by Reuters.\nPassengers on board the ship have been subjected to regular health checks, according to Holland America, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp (CCL.N). There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus on board.\nStoking fears of authorities in countries on the ship\u2019s route has been the ongoing quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp.

That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China,\" the president told reporters at a White House news conference.\n\"So I think it's a very accurate term. I didn't appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.

"}, {"content": "why are malaria pills being used against coronavirus?. Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective.  \n Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION? There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group.  \n It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd <TEVA.TA>, Mylan NV <MYL.O> and Bayer AG <BAYGn.DE> have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums. \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information center at Arizona-based Banner Health.

Wuhan, the provincial capital, recorded a total of 45,346 confirmed cases.\nMeanwhile, Beijing saw a sudden spike in the cases after the central city hospital reported 36 novel coronavirus infections as of Thursday, a sharp increase from nine cases two weeks earlier, leading many to fear a potential explosion of infection numbers in the capital, the Global Times reported.\nAmong the infected at Fuxing Hospital in Xicheng district were eight medical workers, nine cleaning staff and 19 patients along with their families, the report said.\n\"Considering 36 confirmed cases were found in Fuxing Hospital, it is more about one case of multiple infections rather than an epidemic of the whole area,\" Wang Guangfa, director of the department of respiratory and critical care medicine at Peking University First Hospital, said.\nBeijing has so far reported 396 cases of novel coronavirus infection, with four deaths.\nMeanwhile, China has postponed the Boao Forum for Asia, its most prestigious annual meeting held in the picturesque Hainan province where it would invite top world leaders to discuss the economy, trade and related issues.\nThe forum was expected to take place from March 24-27.\nChina hinted at postponing the annual parliament session to be held in the first week of March.\nPlans are also afoot to postpone the National People's Congress -- the country's parliament -- and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) -- China's top political advisory body, official media reported.\nChina is the world's second largest economy after the US.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investment-advisors are increasingly worried that U.S. authorities are not be doing enough to prevent a widespread outbreak of coronavirus in the country, potentially adding further downside to already-battered markets.\nTheir criticisms include the number of people so far tested by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which some say is too small, the possible difficulties of imposing lockdowns on U.S. cities and concerns that the White House could bungle containment efforts.\nThe worries have magnified the uncertainty that has accompanied the coronavirus outbreak over the last several weeks, as investors scramble to adjust their portfolios to price in the virus\u2019 potential for damage to the global economy and assess its further impact on asset prices.\nThe CDC states on its website that \u201cas of Feb. 24, CDC teams are working with the Department of Homeland Security at 11 airports where all flights from China are being directed to screen travelers returning to the United States, and to refer them to U.S. health departments for oversight of self-monitoring.\u201d\nU.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said as of Thursday morning the CDC had tested 3,625 specimens for the fast-moving virus.\nFor some investors and analysts, those assurances ring hollow.\n\u201cMuch of what we\u2019ve seen about this virus has shaken confidence in governments,\u201d said James Bianco, head of Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research.\nHis list includes doubts over China\u2019s accuracy in counting cases, criticism over Japan\u2019s handling of a cruise ship quarantine at one of its ports, and the comparatively small number of people that U.S. authorities have so far tested.\nWorries over the growing number of cases outside China sent the S&P 500 into intraday correction territory on Thursday morning. Stocks took an earlier hit on Wednesday after health officials in Nassau County, New York, said they were monitoring 83 people who visited China and may have come in contact with the coronavirus. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state has had no confirmed cases so far. [L2N2AQ192]\nOn Wednesday evening, U.S. President Donald Trump told Americans that the risk from coronavirus remained \u201cvery low,\u201d and appointed Vice President Mike Pence to run the U.S. response to the looming global health crisis.\nBianco said he fears many investors are still complacent about how quickly the number of cases could multiply in the United States, as it has in countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea.\nHe is advising his clients to tread lightly until the full extent of the outbreak is known.\n\u201cI would rather risk a lost opportunity by being out of the market or underweight and finding out that this is not a big deal, than being fully invested and worrying that this will get worse,\u201d Bianco said.\nOthers are concerned over the consequences if the United States were forced to implement a lockdown similar to the one imposed by Chinese authorities on Hubei Province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\nWuhan, Hubei\u2019s capital, imposed strict controls on movement of residents, then eased them, then later announced that the relaxation had been revoked. Such measures could be more difficult to enforce in the United States.\n\u201cThose of us sitting here in Hong Kong looking at financial markets think there is a tremendous amount of risk in the system,\u201d said Simon Powell, equity strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong.\nPowell is particularly worried that there could be spread of the virus from people from countries outside China which were not subject to travel restrictions coming into the United States. He is particularly concerned about the outbreak in Iran.\nIran said on Thursday that its coronavirus death toll had risen to 26, by far the highest number outside China. The death rate among confirmed cases of the virus has been running at around 10% in Iran compared to around 3% elsewhere.\nPowell also thinks that a Trump government is unlikely to choose reduced economic activity , writing in a recent research note that \u201cour base case hypothesis is that a Trump government is unlikely to choose reduced economic activity, and supply chain disruption, so spread of the virus, if it were to emerge in the US, would be more likely.\u201d\nOthers have pointed to what they believe are shortcomings in the CDC\u2019s approach.\n\u201cThe initial response from the U.S. has been targeted to mount a response to confirmed high-risk or infected cases, not directed to a more generalized public health containment,\u201d said Wouter Jongbloed, head of policy and risk analysis at New York-based Exante Data.\nWith coronavirus having spread well outside China, CDC testing was \u201clikely insufficiently effective in preventing a potential outbreak in the U.S.,\u201d Jongbloed said.

BEIJING \u2014 US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (March 18) doubled down on his recent use of the term \u201cChinese virus\u201d to refer to Covid-19, saying he was simply referring to the virus\u2019 place of origin and that the expression was not racist. \n In a show of defiance against Chinese anger over the use of the term, the president used it within seconds of the start of the daily press conference of his Covid-19 task force, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus\u201d. \n \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not racist at all \u2026 It comes from China,\u201d Mr Trump said when asked why he was using the term amid rising reports of racism against Americans of Chinese ethnicity. \n \u201cI have great love for all of the people from our country but, as you know, China tried to say at one point \u2026 that it was caused by American soldiers. That can\u2019t happen. It\u2019s not going to happen, not as long as I am president. It comes from China,\u201d Mr Trump said. \n \u201cNot think; I know,\u201d he said when asked again whether it was definitive that the virus originated from China. \n Last Thursday, Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, wrote on Twitter that the virus may have originated from the US Army, which took part in Military World Games in Wuhan last October. In response, the US summoned China\u2019s Washington ambassador Cui Tiankai this week to complain about the tweet. \n In posts on the social media platform, which is banned in China, Zhao also shared articles from the Canadian conspiracy site Global Research that suggested Covid-19 had originated in the US. \n At Wednesday\u2019s media conference, Mr Trump demurred when asked about a CBS reporter\u2019s Twitter post on Tuesday that a White House official had referred to the virus as \u201cKung Flu\u201d during a private conversation. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said when asked if the term put Asian-Americans at risk. \u201cThey probably would agree with it 100 per cent, it comes from China.\u201d \n Mr Trump also said he had no plans to ease tariffs on China, amid calls for him to do so by American industry groups. \u201cChina is paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that. They haven't even spoken to me about that,\u201d the president said. \n The press conference \u2013 the third consecutive daily briefing fronted by Mr Trump \u2014 saw a continuation of his dramatic shift of tone regarding the virus, after weeks of downplaying its severity. \u201cWe're going to defeat the invisible enemy, I think we're going to do it even faster than we thought,\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cAnd it will be a complete victory. It'll be a total victory.\u201d \n The president\u2019s comments came as already-strained ties between the two superpowers further soured this week, with both sides trading barbs \u2014\u00a0and conspiracy theories \u2014\u00a0over who was ultimately responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. \n China has reacted with fury at Trump\u2019s and his Republican allies\u2019 insistence on calling the ailment the \u201cChinese coronavirus\u201d or the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d. \n Those names ignore the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) repeated calls for all countries to use the officially assigned terminology \u2014\u00a0Covid-19 for the disease , and SARS-CoV-2 for the virus that causes the illness. \n While epidemics\u2019 names in the past had been based on where most of the infections occurred, the WHO in 2015 issued new guidelines to avoid contagions being identified by geography; the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome was one such example. \n The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in a statement on Tuesday said referring to Covid-19 as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d was akin to \u201ctelling people who to blame, they are telling people who to fear and who to hate\u201d. \n \u201cUnfortunately, we have already seen how this bigotry has impacted Asian-Americans across the country who are facing increased prejudice and violence,\u201d the group said, adding that many from the community had been assaulted to the point of requiring medical care in hospitals. \n \u201cThis is the consequence of spreading xenophobia, something that cannot continue to be amplified by the Trump administration and Republican members. Not now, not ever.\u201d \n China, too, has fanned diplomatic flames. In recent weeks, with the outbreak easing across the mainland, senior diplomatic officials have parroted the theory that the virus did not originate in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, as has been widely presumed by scientists. \n Beijing also provoked anger in Washington on Tuesday when it moved to expel at least 13 American journalists from China by revoking their visas in retaliation for Washington\u2019s move last month to curb the number of journalist visas it issued to staff from five Chinese state-owned media outlets. \n The Chinese action affects journalists from\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0and\u00a0The Wall Street Journal. \n Asked for reaction to the journalists\u2019 impending expulsion, Mr Trump \u2014\u00a0who frequently disparages \u201cfake news\u201d outlets he does not like \u2014\u00a0said: \u201cI am not happy to see it.

MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - The new coronavirus might have infected at least 500,000 people in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the global outbreak, by the time it peaks in coming weeks. \n The typically bustling megacity, where the so-called 2019-nCoV virus emerged late last year, has been in effective lockdown since Jan 23, restricting the movement of 11 million people. Recent trends in reported cases in Wuhan broadly support the preliminary mathematical modelling the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is using to predict the epidemic's transmission dynamics. \n \"Assuming current trends continue, we're still projecting a mid-to-late-February peak\" of virus cases in Wuhan, Adam Kucharski, an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology, said by email Sunday (Feb 9). \"There's a lot of uncertainty, so I'm cautious about picking out a single value for the peak, but it's possible based on current data we might see a peak prevalence over 5 per cent.\" \n That would potentially mean at least 1 in 20 people would have been infected in the city by the time the epidemic peaks, Kucharski said, adding that this may change if transmission patterns slow in coming days. The prediction doesn't indicate a coming surge in cases in Wuhan, but that the current cumulative total doesn't reflect all infections, especially mild ones, that have occurred. \n Health authorities in China and around the world are anxiously waiting to know whether the world's largest known quarantine effort has been effective in containing the pneumonia-causing virus in Wuhan and across other cities in Hubei province, a landlocked region of 60 million people. \n Kucharski, whose research focuses on the dynamics of infectious diseases, and colleagues have based their modelling on a range of assumptions about the 2019-nCoV virus. These include an incubation period of 5.2 days, a delay from the onset of symptoms to confirmation of infection of 6.1 days, and about 10 million people being at risk of infection in Wuhan. \n Based on that, a prevalence of 5 per cent equates to about 500,000 cumulative infections. That's many times more than the 16,902 cases provincial health authorities had counted in Wuhan as of midnight Sunday. \n Researchers will gauge the proportion of people in the population who have been infected with 2019-nCoV after a test becomes available that enables them to conduct a so-called serosurvey to identify those whose blood contains antibodies produced in response to exposure to the virus. \n Currently, the true number of people in Wuhan exposed to the virus \"may be vastly underestimated,\" Manuel Battegay and colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland said in a study published Friday. \"With a focus on thousands of serious cases, mild or asymptomatic courses that possibly account for the bulk of the 2019-nCoV infections might remain largely unrecognised, in particular during the influenza season.\" \n Authorities in China have counted more than 37,000 cases - of which more than 800 have been fatal - over the past two months. That has surpassed the 774 fatalities from the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS, over eight months, according to the World Health Organisation. \n In the first 17,000 or so cases, about 82 per cent are mild, 15 per cent severe and 3 per cent critical, the WHO said Friday. Of 138 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in the first four weeks of January, 26 per cent were placed in intensive care and 4.3 per cent died, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association published Friday found. \n While the fast-moving, infectious coronavirus has caused thousands of people to fall gravely ill and overwhelm hospitals, once researchers understand the full spectrum of illness associated with the virus, the overall case-fatality risk is likely to be much less than 1 per cent, said Ian Lipkin, director of the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York. \n People with mild or no apparent symptoms aren't currently being counted among cases, he told reporters Sunday. A slowdown in the increase in reported cases over the past few days is \"meaningful,\" according to Lipkin, who recently returned to the U.S. from China, where he was advising on the outbreak. He spoke with journalists during a 14-day home quarantine. \n If measures taken so far to contain the outbreak are effective, some \"dramatic reductions\" in infections should be observed in the third or fourth weeks of February, he said. Warmer, early-spring weather might also impede transmission, he said. \n Some studies indicate an infected person may not display symptoms for 14 days or more, with testing and confirmation of cases adding to delays. This will prolong the time it will take to identify whether China's unprecedented disease-control measures have worked. \n \"The next two weeks are really critical to understand what's been happening,\" said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday. \"And, is this going to spread into other locations, or have we avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures that have been implemented to date?\" The number of cases reported in Wuhan and across Hubei province has been tracking downward over the past several days. \n \"There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei, and we're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced,\" Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva Saturday. \"That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place.\" There has been a \"low, but steady incidence\" of infections in places outside Hubei, Ryan said. It's unclear which of those provinces may control the disease or where it might escalate, he said. \n \"We hope that the same stabilisation that appears to be occurring in Wuhan also occurs outside,\" Ryan said. \"But, again it's very, very, very early to make any predictions about numbers.\" \"This is still a very intense disease outbreak in Wuhan and Hubei, and there are still great risks in practically all of the other provinces, so we will wait and see,\" he said.

Many of those flights have now been cancelled, and airports around the world are screening passengers from China for signs of infection.\nIn a major step towards controlling the global spread of the disease, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside of China.\nThe researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne said they would share the sample, grown from an infected patient, with the World Health Organization and laboratories around the world.\n\u201cHaving the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities,\u201d the Doherty Institute\u2019s virus identification laboratory head, Julian Druce, said.\nAsian stock markets erased earlier gains with Hong Kong shares tumbling to a seven-week low on Wednesday as the surge in new cases fuelled fears about the economic impact of the virus.\nPolicy sources have told Reuters that Beijing plans to set an economic growth target of around 6% this year from last year\u2019s 6-6.5%.

Fears of a U.S.-Iran war gave way to the coronavirus pandemic which JPMorgan reckons will have pushed the world economy into a 12% contraction over January to March. The quarter saw the most brutal global equity collapse since the Great Depression, exacerbated by a 60% oil price slump.  \n April may not bring much relief, with coronavirus still spreading rapidly and keeping large parts of the global economy shuttered. Banks have rushed to slash Q2 forecasts too, so expect more turbulence on financial markets.  \n The cavalry has arrived though. G20 governments have promised a $5 trillion revival effort, major central banks have slashed rates and restarted asset purchases. Markets have bounced big and may actually end Q1 on a high. What we need now is to see infection rates peaking and that will show whether April falls, or if it's indeed time for spring.  \n  \n (Graphic: World stocks vs. COVID-19 confirmed cases, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4023/3979/msci.png)  \n  \n 2/PANDEMIC PAYROLLS:  \n Through years of stubbornly low economic growth and inflation, the brightest spot was the U.S. labour market, with unemployment reaching half-century lows. Coronavirus may have ended that boom.  \n With infections surging, cities in lockdown, businesses downing shutters and most travel on ice, staff layoffs are likely to mushroom. That showed up in the number of Americans filing unemployment benefit claims which hit a record of more than 3 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 1 million, though some estimates were as high as 4 million.  \n Now the wait is on for Friday's non-farm payrolls figures that will offer a snapshot of the jobs picture over March. The government's unprecedented $2 trillion fiscal expansion package includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount to fund direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to U.S. families.  \n Economists expect the payroll data to show a loss of 293,000 jobs - the largest monthly drop since July 2009. A significant overshoot of that and the $2 trillion stimulus approved by Congress could suddenly start to look inadequate.  \n  \n (Graphic: Pandemic payrolls, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3945/3901/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 3/CHINA'S PYRRHIC VICTORY  \n The world's factory is re-opening, but the market is closed and the shoppers are gone.  \n China's social isolation policies appear to have contained the coronavirus at home, allowing work and travel to resume. But major economic damage may be yet to come. With infections climbing exponentially in the United States, Europe and the other markets China exports to, and with supply chains in disarray, China is getting neither the imported components it needs nor demand for its products.  \n Already Chinese factories' Jan-Feb profits have hit their lowest in a decade and upcoming manufacturing surveys will very likely reveal more pain. And just like everywhere else , job losses are mounting up, regardless of how many cheap loans are being offered to businesses. Expectations are now for the economy to contract this quarter but many economists reckon 2020 growth will be around 2% - a third of the \"around 6%\" authorities target.  \n  \n (Graphic: China's Industrial profits shrinking, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9258/9170/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 4/COME TOGETHER, RIGHT NOW  \n The European Central Bank has done its bit to tackle the virus damage, having massively expanded asset purchases, agreed to more flexibility on the share of bonds it buys from each country and buffered borrowing costs for weaker euro zone states such as Italy. Now it's up to European Union leaders to come together.  \n So far there is no united front: they've failed to agree on the scale of support for\u00a0economies ravaged by the outbreak. The ECB's aggressive action gives them some breathing space but, as of now, politicians are wrangling over setting up a credit line worth some 2% of annual output from the euro area bailout fund.  \n Many European governments urge the issuance of a joint debt instrument to face a crisis which Goldman Sachs economists estimate may shrink the euro economy by 9% this year. But Germany and some others oppose that. At stake, says France's Emmanuel Macron, is the survival of the European project. The crisis, for sure, is far from over.  \n  \n (Graphic: 10-year bond yield spreads over Germany, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4030/3986/DE2703.png)  \n  \n 5/FRONTIERS ON THE EDGE  \n It's been a tough time for riskier assets in recent weeks, including emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies. But few have felt the pain as much as frontier markets, a subset of smaller and often riskier emerging economies.  \n Many of those frontier economies are in Africa, and are suffering from a toxic combination of tumbling oil and commodity prices, the prospect of the global economy tumbling into recession and weakening currencies which will make servicing external debt ever-more expensive.  \n Oil-producing countries like Angola, Ghana, Gabon and Nigeria have seen their dollar-denominated debt drop sharply, with yields of some issues shooting above 20%, indicating soaring borrowing costs. Many countries on the continent lack the financial firepower or foreign currency reserves needed to combat the coronavirus and prop up their economies, with healthcare systems already under strain.  \n The World Bank and International Monetary Fund on Wednesday urged official bilateral creditors to provide immediate debt relief to the world's poorest countries as they grapple with the human and economic consequences of the pandemic.  \n Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies pledged on Thursday to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus and \"do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic\", expressing concern about Africa in particular. Many hope that the acknowledgement of the need to bolster global financial safety nets and national health systems will translate into action.  \n  \n (Graphic: Africa's soaring borrowing costs, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3971/3927/Africa's%20soaring%20borrowing%20costs.jpg) REUTERS "}, {"content": "Wuhan virus: Japanese shop's 'No Chinese allowed' sign provokes netizens to call for boycott.

"}, {"content": "Origin, symptoms, lethality ... what is known about China's new virus. The new coronavirus 2019-ncov emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan has caused one of the biggest health crises of recent years. What follows are the accretences and open questions about the episode.\nHow did the bud started?\nThe Chinese authorities reported on December 31, 21 cases of pneumonia of unknown origin, seven of them serious. Those affected were apparently linked to a market of the city of Wuhan, a great metropolis with 11 million inhabitants. The cause of the ailment was identified on January 7 as a new coronavirus. China reported days later that the pathogen could be transmitted from person to person.\nWhat symptoms cause the virus?\nThe virus infects the respiratory tract and causes symptoms ranging from a mild box (dry cough, fever ...) to acute respiratory insufficiency and potentially fatal pneumonias.\nHow is it contagious?\nThe mechanisms have not been determined, although the most accepted form is through contact and through small drops of saliva than the bearer of the virus excreted when coughing. The contagion occurs between people who are close, at a distance of approximately one meter maximum.\nAre there asymptomatic cases?\nIt is not yet known exactly, although experts consider that it is likely, as has occurred with other similar viruses.\nIs there a treatment?\nThere is no specific treatment or vaccine, although there are several projects underway to achieve it. Medical assistance focuses on symptoms and giving vital support to the patient. Antivirals such as oseltamivir, Baloxavir, Ribavirin and Acyclovir are not effective against the virus. China studies the combined use of Lopinavir and Ritonavir.\nHow is it diagnosed?\nChina made public the genetic sequence of the virus on January 10, three days after identification. This allowed creating a specific diagnostic protocol with which all member countries have. Without the analyzes, it is practically impossible to distinguish it from another type of pneumonia, or even a flu. The large hospitals have a technology, called PCR, which allows confirming the virus infection in a few hours, although in Spain the official confirmations depend on the National Center of Microbiology.\nWhat is the evolution of the disease?\nThe number of affected has not stopped growing since December 31 and the trend continues to rise in both China and in other countries.\nHas the expansion of the virus been fast?\nExperts emphasize that the great speed of virus propagation. The cases recorded in China in less than a month - January 29, 6,000 have exceeded 5,300 diagnosed with SARS.\nWhat is a coronavirus?\nThey are an extensive virus family that affect the human being and several species of animals. So far there were six acquaintances who could get sick from a person: four that cause the common cold, that of SARS (arising in 2002 also in China) and MERS (in 2012 in Saudi Arabia). Coronavirus that only affect some species can suffer mutations that allow them to jump to others and become virulent to the human being. Acute severe respiratory syndrome (SARS , in its acronym in English) caused more than 800 deaths and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has caused 2,500 confirmed cases and 850 deaths. The investigations carried out so far aim that the origin of both is in bats and this is the main hypothesis also in Wuhan.\nWhat lethality does the new Wuhan virus have?\nExperts point out that the mortality rate of the new pathogen is low, between 2% and 3%, compared to similar viruses, according to the first available data. A mortality from 10% and 18% is attributed to the SAR virus, and that of the Mers reaches 35% of the patients notified, according to WHO.\nCould the virus mutate and become more virulent?\nAlthough all viruses is likely to suffer a mutation, since it was located it has remained quite stable, as the WHO points out, which warns that it is a scenario that can not be ruled out.\nWhat measures have been adopted?\nChina has decided to quarantine to the city of Wuhan, from which it is not possible to leave or enter from the past morning, and more than a dozen localities nearby. In them the use of masks has been widespread. In total, he has confined more than 46 million people. Airports of the vast majority of Asian countries, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia, among others, have established control measures to detect travelers with compatible symptoms from affected areas. Wuhan Airport remains practically closed.\nWhat is WHO doing?\nThe organization has monitored the evolution of the outbreak practically from the first day, since it has located the Coronavirus among the threats to cause a future global pandemic. The Emergency Committee has met twice and, although very divided, has not decided for now to declare an international emergency, although in the last week of January it has changed \"moderate\" to \"high\" the rating of global threat posed by the virus .\nWhat does the international emergency statement imply?\nThe declaration of an emergency of public health of international importance is adopted by a bud a \"serious, sudden, unusual and unexpected situation\" with sanitary consequences whose impact extends beyond the affected country. With the Declaration, the process is initiated that makes possible an immediate and coordinated international action. WHO has adopted this decision five times: by influenza A in 2009, against polio in 2014, against Ebola in West Africa in 2014, against Zika in 2016 and last July against Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo\nIs there a risk to Spain?\nThe Ministry of Health considers that \"taking into account the controls carried out by the Chinese authorities, the risk of introduction of the virus in Spain at this time is considered very low\". In any case, even if the virus arrived, \"the impact for public health\" would also be \"very low\".\nHow will the new coronavirus be called?\nAt the moment, it has one provisional 2019-ncov (new virus 2019), but WHO will decide a definitive one. Normally, they are baptized with the name of the place where they were discovered, so it will probably be the Wuhan virus.

Wuhan is the perfect weapon. It only affects human beings.

(Reuters) - It has been only three months since reports first emerged from China of an unknown virus causing unusual cases of pneumonia, and scientists and public health experts already know more about it and how it works than at the same point in earlier outbreaks.\nBut there\u2019s still a lot they don\u2019t know.\nAs the new coronavirus continues to spread around the world, here are some of the most important questions researchers and doctors \u2013 as well as policymakers and economists \u2013 are still trying to answer:\nHow contagious is the virus?\nThe virus spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It can persist on most surfaces up to several days, so in addition to directly inhaling the virus, you can become infected by touching something that has been contaminated and then touching your own nose, mouth or eyes. There is some evidence that virus particles in the feces of an infected person can transmit the disease through contact, but that remains unconfirmed.\nHow many people are infected, and how many do not show any symptoms?\nSo far, more than 550,000 cases have been reported worldwide, of which more than 127,000 have recovered and more than 24,000 have died. Some researchers estimate that up to 80% of people who are infected show no or only mild symptoms and may not even know they are sick. That would put the number of people who might have been infected in the millions. But we need many more studies and much more testing to close in on a more accurate number.\nGraphic: Tracking the spread of the coronavirus, here\nAre younger people less likely to die from the virus?\nYounger people, while less vulnerable, can still develop COVID-19 - the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus -  severe enough to require hospitalization. Just how much safer they are is still unanswered. The WHO says older people with pre-existing conditions - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease - appear to develop serious illness more often than others, while a U.S. health official said the mortality rate in males appears to be twice that of women in every age group. Health officials have cautioned that anyone with those underlying conditions, as well as those with weakened immune systems, are at increased risk.\nCan people be re-infected?\nThis is a key question \u2013 and we don\u2019t yet know the answer. There are a handful of cases of possible \u201creinfection\u201d in recovered patients. But most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. A patient may feel better and test negative for the virus in their nose and throat, while the virus remains elsewhere in their body. Fully recovered patients have antibodies in their blood that should protect them from fresh infection, but we don\u2019t know how long those antibodies will last. With some viruses, antibodies fade faster. Even if they do persist , SARS-CoV-2 might undergo small changes over time, as flu viruses do each year, rendering the antibodies ineffective.\nSeveral academic laboratories and medical companies are looking to produce blood tests to figure out who has been exposed to the virus and whether some people have developed immunity. Serological testing will also give a better picture of the full extent of the pandemic.\nDo we know when there will be treatments or a vaccine?\nNo. So far there are no vaccines or antiviral medicines specific to the new coronavirus. Treatment for now focuses on relieving symptoms such as breathing assistance. Companies around the world are racing to develop vaccines. A few have launched early safety testing in humans, but experts say it could take a year or more to develop and test a vaccine. Another complication: viruses can mutate quickly. Some scientists have already identified subtle changes since SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December. But recent studies show the virus is relatively stable, which suggests vaccines should still be effective when they become available.\nDoes the virus spread more slowly in hot places?\nSome experts had hoped that the onset of summer will naturally slow the virus. But the European Centre for Disease Control said on Wednesday that it is unlikely to diminish its spread. The WHO has also said that the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including hot and humid climates.\nHow long will the pandemic last?\nWe don\u2019t know. It will depend on a range of factors, from how long people continue to isolate and avoid group gatherings to when effective drugs or a vaccine become available. President Donald Trump said this week that he hopes to \u201creopen\u201d the U.S. economy by Easter Sunday on April 12. But he has faced criticism that such a timetable is too rushed and could lead to more people dying. In Hubei province, the epicenter of China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, life has started to return to normal after two months of lockdown. It remains to be seen whether such a return to normal spurs another outbreak.\nDoes the amount of exposure to the virus determine how sick someone gets?\nViruses enter the body and infect cells, using them as factories to make many millions of copies of themselves, so the number of virus particles that first enter the body has little effect on the eventual amount of virus in the system. At the same time, more frequent exposure does increase the chance that the virus will enter the body in the first place.\nWhen will the economy return to normal?\nThe International Monetary Fund expects the pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. The depth of a recession, how long it will last and the nature of the recovery are a matter of debate. Economists say it will largely depend on how long the lockdowns last \u2013 around a quarter of all humanity is currently in lockdown \u2013 and how far government support goes in helping individuals, businesses and markets survive the crisis.\nAre the trillions of dollars in emergency spending helping?\nCentral bank measures have sought to keep financial markets functioning, including areas that keep the real economy humming, such as the markets where companies go to raise short term cash to pay staff and where cities go to raise money for roads and schools. Steps taken by governments, such as the $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package, are expected to further help the economy by putting cash in the hands of individuals and providing additional funding to small businesses and companies. Such measures still need to work through the system, however, and it remains unclear whether they will be enough.\nIs it a good time to invest?\nSome investors and bank strategists are starting to look at whether people should buy back into the world\u2019s stock markets, which have plunged some 25% from their highs in February. U.S. hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said this week he had turned increasingly positive on stocks and credit and was \u201credeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis.\u201d But with all the uncertainties, many more analysts and investors remain shy about calling the bottom of the market.\nGraphic: COVID-19 in the United States, here "}, {"content": "Weak economic data, coronavirus spook investors. \nThere seems to be little respite in sight for the markets - which have just seen their worst week in a decade - as the impact of coronavirus has started reflecting in economic data.\nFactory activity in China, the global engine of growth, has contracted at the fastest pace on record with China\u2019s official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) falling to a fresh low of 35.7 in February against 50 in January.\nFurther, China and South Korea continued to report more coronavirus cases over the weekend, while\u00a0 the US, Australia, and Thailand reported their first cases of death.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough period,\u201d said Shankar Sharma, founder and vice-chairman of First Global.\n\u201cCoronavirus is a serious problem and can lop off quite a bit from global growth.\u201d\nThe Sensex and Nifty crashed nearly 4 per cent on Friday - the biggest single-day fall since 2015 - to end at 38,297 and 11,202, respectively.\nBoth indices are down nearly 9 per cent from their all-time highs in mid-January.\nOn previous occasions, indices have rebounded sharply after a near-10 per cent drop.\nHowever, a sharp reversal seems difficult this time as the peak impact of the virus is yet to play out.\nThe India VIX surged 31 per cent on Friday, a sign that traders expect the markets - which are back to October levels - to remain highly volatile.\nFurther, most global indices have entered \u201ccorrection zone\u201d, posting a 10 per cent decline from recent highs.\nMany don\u2019t rule out a \u201cbear market\u201d - a fall of 20 per cent from highs - if the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) warning of a global pandemic comes true.\nThe US markets fell 4 per cent in intra-day trade on Friday, before paring losses to end 1.4 per cent lower.\nIn addition, the US 10-year Treasury hit a record low of 1.114 per cent, before settling at 1.163 per cent.\nMarket players say such low reading on the 10-year Treasury is a sign of extreme anxiety.\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulled out close to Rs 12,000 crore last week.\nDomestic investors pumped in an even higher amount, but it did little to stem the fall in share prices.\nSharma said overseas investors typically \u201cchase momentum\u201d and there isn\u2019t much predictability to their flows.\nAs regards a recovery, market players have not ruled out a bounce-back on account of technical factors such as short-covering.\n\u201cHistorically, global events that have caused a meltdown in markets have proved lucrative investment opportunities.\n\"The key point to remember is that we do not know for how long the current crisis may play out.\n\"Therefore, while investing in such times, it is better to make staggered investments,\u201d said S Naren, executive director and chief investment officer of ICICI Prudential AMC "}, {"content": "RPT-China's online censors tighten grip after brief coronavirus respite. (Repeats Feb 11 story with no changes in text)\nBEIJING, Feb 11 (Reuters) - China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has tested the limits of free speech on the country\u2019s heavily censored online and social media, with a brief window of liberalization that opened during January subsequently slammed shut by authorities.\nWhile censorship in China has tightened under President Xi Jinping, questions of transparency around the current outbreak are especially sensitive after Beijing\u2019s cover-up of the extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic fuelled suspicion and mistrust, and led to official calls for openness this time around.\nThe period from Jan 19 to Feb 1, when public concern about the coronavirus exploded just as China was gearing up for the Lunar New Year holiday, saw an uncharacteristic loosening. Online buzz about the outbreak flourished, with netizens largely unfettered in criticizing local authorities - but not central government leaders - over their handling of the crisis.\nThat liberalisation has come to end, with censors in the past week shutting down WeChat groups and scrubbing social media posts, according to Chinese reporters.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Thousands of people have died, the United States response has infuriated European allies, and China has gone on a propaganda offensive. The new coronavirus is shaping up to be a cataclysmic event with far-reaching consequences in global politics. \n The Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 130,000 people globally, strikes a world already in flux with the rise of nationalists such as US President Donald Trump who have scoffed at the rules of the \"globalist\" order. \n \"When the dust settles on the Covid-19 world, we won't be in the same place that we were just a week ago,\" said Mr Jon Alterman, a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \n \"We know that governments will shake as citizens judge them to have fumbled in their response. We know that economies will be disrupted and some economies are likely to collapse,\" he said. \n Mr Trump, who initially dismissed the risks of Covid-19, late on Wednesday (March 11) abruptly imposed a 30-day ban on most travel from mainland Europe and vowed to confront the \"foreign virus\". Leaders from the European Union voiced outrage at the move, which triggered chaos at airports, and said that they had not been consulted - which Mr Trump acknowledged. \n Ms Kelly Magsamen, the vice-president for national security and international policy at the left-leaning Centre for American Progress, said Mr Trump's move would only increase questions about Washington's historic leadership role. \n \"I think a lot of partners and allies are saying, can the US be relied upon to lead on major global challenges - whether it's a pandemic or whether it's climate change or nonproliferation?\" she said. \n \"It's going to have effects on other dimensions of our relationship.\" \n Covid-19 first emerged late last year in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan - likely at a market that sold exotic animals for their meat - and Beijing initially tried to suppress the news including by detaining the doctor who sounded the alarm. \n But China in the past week has sought to turn its Covid-19 response into a sort of soft power, with President Xi Jinping visiting Wuhan to trumpet success at containing the spread. \n China has sent medical equipment to Italy, the second-worst hit country, and Spain, highlighting its authoritarian model as decisive. \n It has also used the crisis as leverage against the United States, which has been seeking to combat Beijing's influence in all areas. \n An article in the state-run Global Times unsubtly hinted that China could stop exports of face masks and other medical gear if the Trump administration keeps pressing to restrict its tech giant Huawei. \n China as well as Russia has also promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to discredit the US. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter that the US military may have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. \n The Trump administration, which has offered US$100 million (S$141 million) in aid worldwide to help other countries deal with the pandemic, has in turn sought to associate China firmly with Covid-19. \n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks of the illness as the \"Wuhan virus\" and Republican Senator Tom Cotton has vowed that the US will \"hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.\" \n Mr Michael Green, who was the top Asia adviser to former president George W. Bush, doubted that China would ultimately find many buyers for its \"arguments about the failures of democracy\". \n But he added: \"That does not mean that the US will win this information battle.\" \n \"While the Japanese and others in Asia are not getting the shock treatment that the Europeans got overnight, there is a very strong sense of questioning American leadership right now,\" said Mr Green, now a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \n In one example, Mr Green pointed to the stalemate in talks over South Korea's contributions to US bases, with Mr Trump irritating the ally by insisting on much higher payments. \n One broader effect, Mr Green said, may be a shifting political narrative. \n Mr Xi, once seen as untouchable in China, has faced criticism as netizens cheer on doctors - much like Americans across party lines have hailed Dr Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old veteran head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Trump's 2016 upset win, Britain's vote to leave the European Union and other populist victories had been seen as proof \"that the technocrats failed\" following the Great Recession of the late 2000s and the Iraq war, Mr Green said. \n \"I think it's very possible that the macro result this time could be that the political populists failed and it's the technocrats who emerge as the heroes,\" Mr Green said. \n \"We'll see.

Hence, there is a delay in transportation of the mortal remains of Rita Rajinder Mehra to India by the agency hired by Puneet Mehra, Kumar said in his reply.\nThe consular also said that as per the existing regulations in China, funeral homes in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou only are authorised to carry out embalming and anti-sepsis procedures of mortal remains of a foreigner for air transportation.\nAs of now, the Chinese government has placed complete restrictions on the funeral homes from accepting a body from any place out of these three cities. It means these funeral homes can only deal with the body that pertains to the respective city, he mentioned.\nAnother major obstacle in transporting the mortal remains from the morgue of Zhengzhou to Beijing is severe restrictions on inter-provincial movements, he informed Mehra.\n\"While it is going to be our earnest endeavour with the Chinese authorities to seek their indulgence in allowing the concession in the imposed regulations to allow the mortal remains to be transported to India, yet we cannot predict at this stage whether our pursuance would melt the Chinese authorities,\" Kumar said.\n\"However, we will try our hardest and hope as well as pray that we succeed.

The inhibitor uses protease acting on the virus to prevent the protein from cracking, thus preventing the formation of the mature virus. \n At present, the preparation developed by the team is effective in mice infected with Sars-CoV and stable in human cell culture experiments. \n Scientists have found that the 2019-nCov is 80 per cent similar to the Sars-CoV, and the similarity between the protease of these two viruses is as high as 96 per cent. Hilgenfeld hopes that the inhibitors can help the research on 2019-nCov drugs. \n In an interview with CMG, he said that the experiments on 2019-nCov will be carried out on mice, and toxicological experiments will be carried out to eliminate other side effects that may be caused by the drugs. Finally, mass production will be possible only through clinical trials. \n The coronavirus is self-limiting. After a period of time, when enough people produce antibodies, the continuous spread of the virus can be restricted, thus ending the spread of the epidemic, he said.

Hong Kong/Canada/New York (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - Private organizations and government agencies are scrambling to implement business continuity planning (BCP) measures for the 2019 novel coronavirus, an infectious disease that came into broader public knowledge mere weeks ago.\nTo date, more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been documented worldwide, with the majority of the cases clustered in Hubei province, China. To try to curb infection rates, the Chinese government has implemented social distancing policies which have substantially slowed business activity in the region. Other countries are increasingly implementing ad hoc measures, including travel restrictions and quarantine measures, to prevent an outbreak from occurring in their respective jurisdictions.\nDevelopments are unfolding at an accelerated pace and organizations have much ground to cover in BCPs. The maintenance of operational agility, succession planning and employee morale are just some of the main considerations at play.\nIn mainland China, the Chinese government has extended the Chinese New Year holiday through February 2, to encourage social distancing to mitigate the spread of the virus. Provincial and national regulators have issued guidance for employers regarding employee rights and entitlements to remuneration during this time. Uncertainty regarding the interpretation of these regulatory notices has caused confusion over whether some business continuity practices, such as requesting employees to use vacation days during the extended holiday, are legal.\nEnterprise Singapore, a government agency, has issued a guide{here} on business continuity planning for the novel coronavirus. The guide recommends that businesses appoint a designated manager to oversee coronavirus-related business continuity measures. The importance of succession planning for key personnel in addition to senior managers, including communications, human resources and operations staff is heavily emphasized. Businesses are also advised to establish alternate teams for critical operational functions and to keep these teams physically segregated at all times.\nIn practice, segregating teams may require businesses to place extensive restrictions on employees, even outside working hours. For example, the South China Morning Post, an English language newspaper in Hong Kong, established separate workspaces for alternate teams in different districts of the city during a regional outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Alternate teams were sent to work in different locations and were prohibited from having any physical contact with members of the other team during and after work hours for a period of three months.\nMany companies in Hong Kong have activated extensive BCPs for the novel coronavirus in comparison to jurisdictions with similar numbers of confirmed cases , partially due to containment measures from the local government, lessons learned during the SARs outbreak and the region\u2019s close proximity to mainland China. Measures that have been implemented include remote working arrangements for a large percentage of the workforce. Some companies have provided personal protection supplies such as surgical masks and hand disinfectant for employees who have to come to the office to perform their job duties. Policies suspending business travel to cluster areas for the coronavirus have been implemented by numerous businesses. Some organizations have even sought to prohibit employee personal travel to cluster areas.\nIn comparison, there have been fewer reports of companies in South Korea, Japan or Thailand implementing business continuity measures such as asking employees to work from home or limiting employee travel.\nIn Canada, some businesses have begun to execute pandemic preparedness measures such as training staff on what to do if they encounter someone who is ill, or if a customer-facing employee should fall ill at work. Local disaster management experts have expressed concern that some organizations, especially smaller firms, may lack the adequate resources or expertise to put measures in place that can effectively deal with employee health and operational risks posed by the novel coronavirus.\nInternationally, businesses are struggling with disruptions to their supply chains in China{here}, where manufacturing and logistics activity has slowed to a crawl across the country. Technology companies are expected to be most affected; however, many other commodities, goods and services will also be significantly affected. Companies such as H&M, Japan Airlines, Baidu Inc, McDonald's and Tesla have all recently warned that the outbreak in China will have an impact on their businesses.\nBCP for the novel coronavirus is proving to be difficult, requiring businesses to consider operational and financial risks alongside health risks to one of their most valuable assets: talent. Safeguarding the wellbeing of employees plays an important role in keeping a company operational during this uncertain time. While practices implemented by companies have delved into infection control measures such as personal hygiene and social distancing, challenges in maintaining employee morale have not been discussed with the same fervor.\nSome important issues to consider in BCPs include how to handle fear and xenophobia that have arisen due to concerns over the novel coronavirus. BCP designated personnel need to consider how to manage anxiety in the workplace, even over scenarios that would be benign during normal times, such as an employee who shows up to work with a minor cough.\nBusinesses that choose to implement work from home arrangements for large swathes of the workforce will need to consider how to help employees who are not accustomed to working remotely stay motivated during this time, alongside infrastructure concerns such as bandwidth and capacity issues for remote access of work servers, conferencing lines and other necessities.\nMoreover, managers must consider how to balance their legal responsibility to treat all employees fairly against any measures the company may have to take to mitigate the risk of widespread infection at their firms. Consideration for the mental wellbeing of employees needs to be factored in alongside practices to safeguard their physical health against illness.\nPlanning for an extended and uncertain period time in which businesses may have to run on contingency measures is another significant consideration for businesses. The novel coronavirus remains somewhat of a mystery. Health agencies are in the midst of containment efforts; however, it is uncertain how long these initiatives may take to bring regional outbreaks under control, or if these initiatives will be successful at all in preventing more widespread infection. As a result, businesses must examine how they will function under different scenarios and at varying percentages of operational capacity. Critical tasks will have to be identified and many organizations will have to make tough decisions weighing risk against productivity just in order to stay afloat.\n*To read more by the Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence team click here: bit.ly/TR-RegIntel\n(By Helen Chan, Regulatory Intelligence) "}, {"content": "Breakingviews - China\u2019s viral immune system open to economic pox. HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China\u2019s political system has weak immunity to viruses. A bungled swine flu cover-up doubled pork prices last year. Now a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia is panicking citizens just days before the start of what\u2019s usually a $150 billion spending boom: the lunar new year holiday. President Xi Jinping\u2019s corruption purge may have made officials less venal, but not, apparently, more credible.\nConcealing epidemics, environmental crises, and product scandals was once reflexive behaviour for local governments. Burying bad news can head off career-ending popular protests. Now officials\u00a0must manage the flow of facts and rumour\u00a0about a virus that emerged in Wuhan,\u00a0a large city in central China.\nWhen it comes to infectious disease,\u00a0local\u00a0censorship slows medical response and facilitates transmission. That\u2019s what happened with the\u00a0Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\u00a0in 2003, a coronavirus similar to that found in Wuhan. SARS killed nearly 800 people, docked a percentage point from China\u2019s economic growth, and erased up to $18 billion in travel, tourism and retail sales in Asia, according to one academic estimate.\nBeijing scored transparency points with its handling of the H7N9 avian flu in 2013, but\u00a0then\u00a0fumbled\u00a0its\u00a0response to African swine flu, which\u00a0some\u00a0officials\u00a0initially\u00a0tried to cover up.\u00a0Around half of China\u2019s herd had to be culled.\nDistrust is a tax that distorts consumption. After the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, some residents of the provincial capital disregarded official reassurances, hoarding bottled water\u00a0and camping\u00a0outside for months on end, refusing to believe their buildings were safe.\u00a0The 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan caused a bizarre rush on iodized salt in China.\nThe coronavirus has already killed four and infected hundreds. It has spread overseas.\u00a0With an estimated 400 million Chinese planning to travel for the holiday, the question is how many will still go and spend.\nXi\u2019s massive purge of\u00a0corrupt\u00a0officials made him popular, but it was packaged with tighter control of media, and suppression of negative economic commentary. This encourages officials to report only good news, so some will naturally try to control disease outbreaks before they become public. When that backfires, the result is personal tragedy and economic waste. "}, {"content": "Radio program clarified on coronavirus satire that revolted Chinese community.

SINGAPORE:\u00a0Like many others on the frontline during the SARS\u00a0(severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Choa Chu Kang had been stretched thin. \n Personal protective equipment -\u00a0N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns -\u00a0was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves. \n Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus. \n By the time SARS was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan\u2019s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for SARS\u00a0patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear.

Find out which one. A team of Chinese scientists has shown that pangolins are coronavirus carriers closely related to SARS-COV-2, causing current pandemic, but not enough to conclude that they are directly responsible for the transmission of virus to humans.\r\nSARS-COV-2 emerged in a Wuhan (China) market in which wild animals were sold and, although there are evidence that suggests that bats are the reservoir of the syndrome, today scientists continue without knowing that animal can be the intermediate guest which facilitated the transmission of virus to humans.\n\nToday, a genomic study, led by the Chinese virologists Yi Guan, from the University of Hong Kong, and Yan-Ling Hu, from the University of Medicine of Guangxi, published in Nature magazine, advances that Malaysian Pangolins are patients with CORONViruses related to SARS- COV-2.\nThe similarity between these coronaviruses and what caused the pandemic is not enough to confirm that the pangolins are guests who have transmitted the current beat of bats to humans, but the discoveries suggest that these wild mammals are \"a second Coronavirus guest \", so the sale in wild fauna markets should be strictly prohibited to avoid future transmissions, warn scientists.\nIn the study, they recall that shortly after the start of the outbreak, the Wuhan market - the initial focus of the infection - was dismantled, which prevented the animal species in which coronavirus arose.\nOne possible guest could be Pangolim, the most trafficked mammal and who uses as food and traditional Chinese medicine.\nFor work, Yi Guan and colleagues analyzed samples from 18 Malaysian Pangolins seized in fighting operations against Contrabando in southern China, between August 2017 and January 2018, and in all found different types of coronaviruses.\nThe viruses of these samples had a genetic similarity between 85% to 92% with SARS-COV-2.\nIn addition, in one of these viruses, the region that facilitates the entry into the cell is very similar to that of the current virus.\nNevertheless, none of the coronavirus of Pangolim had the specific alteration of human SARS-COV-2, which raises doubts that pangolins are directly responsible in the transmission of coronavirus to humans.\nStill, the authors of the study warn that the pangolins should not sell themselves in markets and propose greater surveillance of these animals to understand their role in the emergence of coronavirus with potential to infect human beings.\nThe new coronavirus, responsible for the pandemic of Covid-19, has already infected 480,000 people around the world, of which about 22,000 died.\nAfter arising in China, in December, the outbreak spread all over the world, which led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic situation.\nThe European continent, with almost 260,000 infected, is the one that is currently emerging as many cases.

The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspected patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID.

NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - The drug touted by United States President Donald Trump as a possible line of treatment against the coronavirus comes with severe warnings in China and can kill in dosages as small as 2g. \n China, where the deadly pathogen first emerged in December, recommended the decades-old malaria drug chloroquine to treat infected patients in guidelines issued in February after seeing encouraging results in clinical trials. But within days, it cautioned doctors and health officials about the drug's lethal side effects and rolled back its usage. \n This came after local media reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology study found that the drug can kill an adult dosed at just twice the daily amount recommended for treatment, which is 1g. \n As the drug has not been approved by the US Food And Drug Administration to treat the disease known as Covid-19, the Chinese experience may be useful as the American regulator studies the medication which has been endorsed by Mr Trump as well as Tesla\u00a0chief executive officer Elon Musk. \n The pandemic, which has sickened more than 235,000 globally and killed over 9,800 people, has triggered growing anxiety across the US as states say they lack testing kits and medical equipment. California instituted a statewide lockdown on Thursday (March 19) to slow the outbreak. \n Chloroquine was among the first group of therapies Chinese scientists identified as being effective in curbing the new coronavirus. Clinical trials on about 130 patients demonstrated the drug's ability to reduce the severity of the illness and speed up virus clearance, according to China's Ministry of Sciences and Technology. \n Chloroquine phosphate was officially recommended on Feb 19 in the Covid-19 treatment guidelines published by China's National Health Commission, along with a few other drugs such as AbbVie Inc's Kaletra and flu drug arbidol as antiviral treatments for patients. The commission recommended no more than a 10-day course of chloroquine for adult patients at 500mg - half a gram - twice a day. \n As hundreds of clinical trials are launched to study potential Covid-19 treatments, stocks of drugmakers and biotechnology companies have racked up big gains on the hope that the industry will see a windfall. But the history of previous viral outbreaks like Ebola and Zika show little success in producing viable treatments. Some potential drugs were developed only after the epidemics already waned through containment measures. \n China's recommendation to use chloroquine in treatment was quickly followed by a warning. \n Two days after the treatment guideline update, the health authorities in Hubei province - China's worst-hit region, where the outbreak started and which accounted for the majority of its over 80,000 patients - asked hospitals to closely watch for, and immediately report, any adverse side effects of chloroquine phosphate, according to a report in local media outlet The Paper. \n The drug is known to have short-term side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and tinnitus, while long-term use can irreversibly impair eyesight. It is forbidden for pregnant women, as it can cause congenital defects in babies. \n The China Health Commission revised the dosage in a Feb 29 notice tightening chloroquine use. The drug cannot be given to pregnant women, those with heart disease, terminal liver and renal disease, retina and hearing loss and patients on antibiotics such as azithromycin and steroid. \n It can now be given only to patients between 18 and\u00a065 years of age for a seven-day treatment course. Patients weighing over 50kg can take 500mg twice a day - the usual dose - while those weighing less will be administered the drug just once a day after two days of use, according to the latest guidelines.

BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Scientists in the city at the centre of China\u2019s virus outbreak have applied to patent a drug made by United States (US) company Gilead Science Inc to treat the disease, possibly fuelling conflict over technology policy that helped trigger Washington\u2019s tariff war with Beijing.The government-run Wuhan Institute of Virology said this week it applied for the patent in January along with a military laboratory. An institute statement acknowledged there are \u201cintellectual property barriers\u201d but said it acted to \u201cprotect national interests\u201d.Granting its own scientists a patent might give the Chinese government leverage in negotiations over paying for the drug. But it also might fuel complaints Beijing abuses its regulatory system to pressure foreign companies to hand over valuable technology.Yesterday, the official Xinhua News Agency said clinical trials of the drug, remdesivir, were due to start.Gilead, headquartered in Foster City, California, said it applied in 2016 for a Chinese patent on use of remdesivir against coronaviruses and is waiting for a decision. The coronavirus family includes the novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, blamed for the outbreak in Wuhan.\u201cGilead has no influence over whether a patent office issues a patent to the Chinese researchers,\u201d said a company spokesman, Ryan McKeel. \u201cTheir application has been filed more than three years after Gilead\u2019s filing and will be considered in view of what is already known about the compound and pending patent applications.\u201dThe institute said its application was filed on January 21. Two days later, Chinese authorities suspended most access to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to surrounding cities and some in other provinces, isolating a total of about 60 million people in the most sweeping anti-disease measures ever imposed.China has the right under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to declare an emergency and compel a company to licence a patent to protect the public.It would be required to pay a license fee that is deemed fair market value.The government might be able to avoid that fee if the patent were granted to the Wuhan institute, part of the elite Chinese Academy of Sciences.The institute said it applied for a \u201cuse patent\u201d that specifies the Wuhan virus as the drug\u2019s target. Gilead\u2019s patent application, filed before the virus was identified, cites only the overall family of coronaviruses.The Chinese researchers made their patent application \u201cfrom the perspective of protecting national interests,\u201d said the institute\u2019s statement.\u201cIf relevant foreign companies plan to contribute to China\u2019s epidemic prevention and control, we both agree that if the state needs it, we will not require enforcement of rights given by the patent,\u201d it said.Gilead said last week it was working with US and Chinese health authorities on studying remdesivir. The company said it has provided the drug for emergency use in a small number of patients with the Wuhan virus \u201cin the absence of any approved treatment options\u201d.

By Mohd Fharkhan Abdul GhaparKUALA LUMPUR, Jan 30\u00a0 -- Malaysia has been more prepared and proactive, and has also acted faster in containing the novel coronavirus compared to previous times when faced with dangerous infections such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory\u00a0Syndrome), the Nipah virus and Ebola.Infectious disease specialist Datuk Dr\u00a0Christopher\u00a0K.C.\u00a0Lee told Bernama yesterday that its experience in containing these past infectious diseases had made Malaysia more prepared to deal with such situations, and this included having more thermal scanners which have been placed at all entry points into the country, as well as its actions in isolating coronavirus cases and placing suspected cases under quarantine.He said swift measures such as these were important in reducing potential local transmissions of the virus in the country.\"Compared to SARS in 2002, when we took weeks to trace the infections, now we have managed to do so much earlier due to our experience, expertise and the technology employed.\"We are now in a containment phase, to prevent any local transmission. The seven cases that have been detected were not infected in Malaysia but overseas, and imported into the country. It is important that we prevent the infections from spreading within the country,\" Dr Lee explained.The new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was first detected in December, in Wuhan, China, causing pneumonia and symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulties. As of last night, Malaysia had seven confirmed cases.The specialist added that apart from thermal scanners, the dissemination of information to every tourist entering Malaysia, particularly tourists from infected areas, was also important.\"They (tourists) need to be given information about the virus and actions needed such as seeking\u00a0treatment at specific hospitals if they do not feel well.\"This is important because when they entered Malaysia, they may not have had a fever or other symptoms but may have fallen ill several days later,\" Dr Lee stressed.The specialist who is experienced in handling SARS, Nipah virus and\u00a0Ebola cases, noted that the outbreak of the virus in affected areas such as Wuhan, had occurred at a faster rate compared to other infectious diseases, and the world still had insufficient data on the new virus.The spread of the virus had been exacerbated by the increased movement of people within\u00a0and out of China\u00a0in conjunction with the Chinese New Year celebrations.\u00a0\u201cIt\u00a0makes things a bit complicated,\u201d he said.Asked about claims that the coronavirus could be spread through its presence on the surface of goods imported from China, Dr Lee said the possibility of such an occurrence was low because many viruses could only last within a particular environment for a period ranging from a few hours to a few days, and this would be dependent on the context.\"Although we do not have enough information on the coronavirus, we believe it is like SARS and influenza which\u00a0won\u2019t last long in the environment,\" he added.\u00a0-- BERNAMA "}, {"content": "Coronavirus India cases and deaths: Best or worst, this online epidemic calculator shows Covid-19 projections. What is going to be the future of Covid-19 in India? For how long coronavirus will infect people here? How many people are going to fall sick with Covid-19 in India? And how many people may die of Covid-19 here? No one has a sure answer to these questions. Possibly because no one can have an answer to these questions. But in case you are curious there is an online tool created by a machine learning expert that shows the course Covid-19 pandemic may take in India. It is a simple tool, but one based on SEIR model that scientists and public health experts use to predict epidemic in a given region.\nThe tool has been created by Gabriel Goh, a machine learning researcher.\nThere is nothing official about the tool but during a time when the information from government experts may not be coming or coming fast enough it can shed some clarity on what Covid-19 can do to India. Depending on what measures the country takes, and what impact these measures have on Covid-19 infections in India, coronavirus may end up killing around 1000 people to 5 million people in India, according to the Epidemic Calculator. Why such gap between these two numbers?\nAccording to the Epidemic Calculator, it all depends on flattening the curve, bringing down R0 the rate at which infections spread and at what stage the lockdown was enforced and ordered.\nAt the time of writing, the coronavirus disease of 2019 remains a global health crisis of grave and uncertain magnitude. To the non-expert (such as myself), contextualizing the numbers, forecasts and epidemiological parameters described in the media and literature can be challenging. I created this calculator as an attempt to address this gap in understanding, notes Goh. This calculator implements a classical infectious disease model -- SEIR (Susceptible > Exposed > Infected > Removed) -- an idealized model of spread still used in frontlines of research.\nBy default the tool already has the relevant data, based on the research reports that have come out on Covid-19 from China and other countries so far, in the required fields. To see how Covid-19 will progress in India on the basis of this available data about coronavirus, and how it infects people, how many it kills, for how long it keeps people sick, all you need to do is change the population of the region to India\u2019s population.\nHere are some projections this tool gives as far Covid-19 and its future progression in India is concerned:\nCovid-19 in India with default data\nWith default data, which considers the infection rate R0 of 2.2 it means a coronavirus patient is likely to infect at least two more people the coronavirus Epidemic Calculator indicates that in a year the disease will infect a little over 1 million people in India. Of these, it will kill little over 20,000 people. While you look at these numbers, there are a few important bits to remember.\n-- By default the Epidemic Calculator assumes that on the 100th day after the first reported case the government has forced the region or country into a full lockdown.\n-- The lockdown or intervention in some other way , brings down the R0 to less than 1. This is very important.\n-- If the lockdown or intervention has brought the R0 lower earlier, say just 50 days after the first case was reported, the total number of cases will be significantly less and number of fatalities exponentially lower.\n-- It is also important to remember that by default the Epidemic Calculator considers fatality rate for Covid-19 as 2 per cent. In China, it has been slightly more. In South Korea and Germany it is significantly less. In Italy and Spain, it is alarmingly high, particularly in Italy where it is above 8 per cent. If you consider other figures for India depending on which one you do the covid-19 picture will change.\nThe covid-19 case fatality rate for India is something neither experts nor Epidemic Calculator can predict. The global fatality rate for swine flu is less than 0.1 per cent. But in India, in the previous swine flu epidemics, the death rate has been close to 6 per cent. For Covid-19 only time will tell what is the fatality rate in India.\nCovid-19 in India a best case scenario\nSo, what is the best case scenario for covid-19 in India. If everything works well in India, if government mounts a good response, and death rate is not above 2 per cent, health care system holds up, quarantine is effective, then covid-19 may end up infecting a little above 15,000 people. This also takes into account the fact that in India the first case was detected on January 30 and the lockdown was ordered on March 24. Assuming that the coronavirus became infectious in India a few days before the first patient was detected, we can say that the country mounted effective response on around Day 65 of the disease. This can potentially limit number of Ccovid-19 cases in India to around 15,000 and deaths to around 300. Let's hope this is the case.\nCovid-19 in India worst case scenario\nNow, take the worst case scenario. This is the one where the data that we have so far from the government is not accurate, the quarantine is not effective, the health system is not ready and will not be able to hold up well, that the disease is spreading in India undetected for far longer even though the first case was only found on January 30. In this case, also assume that India\u2019s poor health system will not be able to cope up with Covid-19 when cases start to rise and let\u2019s move the case fatality rate to 4 per cent, which is still significantly lower than what Covid-19 is showing in Italy and Spain but is higher than the global rate. Let\u2019s also assume that the quarantine doesn\u2019t bring down the R0 much. May be a half per cent or so but not enough to flatten the curve in one year.\nIn this case, given that population of India is little over 1.3 billion, we may end up seeing around 180 million infected in the country this year and little over 5 million dead.\nThis is all projection\nIt\u2019s important to note that Covid-19 epidemic calculator is a tool that creates projections on the basis of data you feed into it. And as far as Covid-19 and novel coronavirus are concerned, right now not enough data, and not accurate enough data, is available. Everything is an approximation. What is the real fatality rate of Covid-19? Different countries are showing different numbers and they are all over the place, with extremely huge gaps between them. How quickly and how widely this is R0 that Covid-19 spreads? Again, we don\u2019t know the exact number. Some studies say it is 4. Some say it is 2. Some even say that it is 6.\nThen there are other unknowns. Can Covid-19 re-infect people who were sick with it and then got better? We don\u2019t know for sure. Does temperature India is a very hot country and dry air summer is coming in parts of India affect this coronavirus? And if it does, how much? We don\u2019t know for sure. There are many more factors, like real world conditions. How long Covid-19 patients take to recover? For how long they are infectious? For how long they have to be in a hospital? For how long a country can care for its ICU patients? These are the figures that government experts and policy makers probably know. An online epidemic calculator doesn\u2019t. So if you are giving the online epidemic calculator created by Gabriel Goh a spin, keep this in mind. "}, {"content": "China prohibits trading with wild animals by Wuhan Coronavirus. It was enough to use some keywords: \"Hunting\", \"wild flavor\", or \"totally natural\". On some most popular Chinese e-commerce platforms until now it was possible to find, investigating a little, the most exotic meats. Like the civet, the feline who served as a transmitter to human beings of the SARS-causing virus in 2003, at 350 yuan (46 euros) kilo. Or peacock. O Giant salamanders. It is no longer as easy, at least for a while. As a result of the new Coronavirus of Wuhan, transmitted to human beings by an animal sold in one of the markets of that city, the Chinese government has just prohibited - although at the moment, only provisionally - the trade and transportation of wild species.\nThe joint order issued by three official entities, including the Ministry of Agriculture prohibits any type of trade with these animals, alive or dead, on any platform, although it specifically mentions electronic commerce, restaurants, supermarkets or markets. Local authorities will increase inspections and punishments to those who violate the prohibition will be \"severe\". The breeding farms of these animals will be quarantine.\n\"Consumers must fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals, they have to stay away from the wild flavor and eat healthy,\" says the norm.\nThe passage has occurred after scientists trace the origin of the new Coronavirus, which has caused the death of at least 56 people and infected more than 2,000 only in China - and more than thirty in the rest of the world - to a Market in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of infection. Although theoretically the market Huanan-well closed at Cal and singing - was dedicated to the sale of seafood and fish, all kinds of caged animals were also sold. A price list that has circulated by social networks included a hundred species, from wolf cubs or camel meat. Also marmots, foxes or monkeys. Or snakes, mice, cats and dogs.\nScientists have not managed to safely identify the species, but they have determined that Coronavirus 2019-NECOG passed to humans through an animal. A group of Chinese scientists has published that it was probably a snake; Others consider that it could be a bat.\nA situation identical to which triggered the SARS epidemic in 2003: scientists determined that the transmitter of that coronavirus -remparmed with that of Wuhan-had been civetic meat sold in a canton market. That focus ended up infecting 8,422 people and causing death to almost 800.\nThen, as now, trade with wild animals was banned. But, as now, temporarily. The interest in the consumption of these meats also decreased. But temporarily.\nChina is still a voracious consumer of wild animal products , to the point of increasing the risk of extinction of some species. The demand, either as food or for its use in traditional medicine, has grown in parallel with the prosperity of the country. Among certain sectors, eating meats the more exotic and difficult to obtain Sean is a way to exhibit social position. In other cases, such as dog consumption at the Yulin Festival, in the south, eating that meat is almost an act of claiming supposed national roots.\nMarkets like Wuhan's are not rare. An investigation that the Beijing News newspaper published last week found that, a month after the first contagions were detected in Wuhan, it was still possible in different provinces markets willing to sell, restaurants willing to prepare and, in Internet forums, consumers willing to pay what it was necessary for this type of food.\nThe problem in these markets are not only the hygiene conditions in which animals are maintained, often deficient. Also the difficulty of establishing the origin of the copies. Although there are farms that are dedicated to the breeding of these species with a license - it is estimated that those of Tigre welcome some 6,000 copies - activists denounce that it is not infrequent that wild animals captured end up in any of them; or that the licenses have been obtained illegally.\nAlthough the virulence of Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak has made the voices against these practices multiply. Last week, 19 prominent scientists sent an open letter to the government to request the limitation of that trade. \"It is not only important for ecological conservation, but because of its great importance to control public health risks,\" they Alertaban. Experts also request that \"legal gaps\" be resolved in permits for domestication and breeding wild animals, which allow traffickers to hunt animals released and sell them in the market through farms.\n\"The viruses transmitted by animals are human pathogens that appear more frequently. They represent less than 15% of all known species of human pathogens, but more than 65% of discovered pathogens since 1980, \"says Christian Walzer's statement, the Executive Director of the NGO Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), based in New York\nThe consumption of wild meat has also been on debate on Chinese networks. \"If humans do not live in harmony with nature, of course nature is going to return the blow!\", Commented a Weibo user, Chinese Twitter.\nAt the moment, the prohibition that arrives from Beijing is only temporary. The order issued this Sunday requires that it will last only \"until the epidemic situation throughout the country disappears.\"\nOrganizations such as WCS claim that it be permanent. Not only in China, but throughout the world. \"If those markets continue, and the human consumption of illegal and unclear wild animals continues, the public will continue to face greater risks of new viruses, potentially more lethal and sources of future pandemics,\" Walzer says.

BEIJING (AFP) - Police in China's virus epicentre Wuhan acted \"inappropriately\" by punishing a doctor who blew the whistle on the outbreak that has now killed more than 9,000 worldwide, a Chinese government investigation found on Thursday (March 19). \n Dr Li Wenliang, one of a group of doctors in Wuhan who shared posts on social media warning of a Sars-like virus spreading in the city in December, was reprimanded by police for sharing the information and made to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more \"law-breaking actions\". \n His death from the virus in February prompted a national outpouring of grief as well as anger at the government's handling of the crisis, and bold demands for freedom of speech. \n A central government investigation initiated after Dr Li's death found that Wuhan police \"acted inappropriately by issuing a disciplinary letter\" and took \"irregular law enforcement procedures,\" state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday. \n The investigators also found that Dr Li's colleagues had repeatedly attempted to resuscitate the 34-year-old before he was declared dead because he was \"very young\", CCTV said. \n State media said his colleagues told investigators, \"as long as there was a bit of hope, we were unwilling to give up, at the time there were no other factors\". \n The central government investigators \"suggest\" that Wuhan authorities \"supervise and rectify the matter\", and urged local police to revoke the disciplinary statement issued to Dr Li, according to CCTV. \n Beijing has sought to direct criticism over the mishandling of the virus outbreak onto provincial officials, with several of the region's top Communist Party and health officials sacked. \n Dr Li's death had initially been reported by state media before their reports were quickly deleted. Wuhan Central Hospital confirmed Dr Li's death only hours later, after saying he was undergoing emergency treatment. \n Social media users who immediately took to the Twitter-like Weibo platform in droves to mourn Dr Li - before posts related to his death were scrubbed by censors - had accused hospital authorities of inappropriately attempting to resuscitate him after he had already died. \n China reported zero domestic Covid-19 infections for the first time on Thursday, even as nations across the world shut down in a desperate effort to contain the pandemic. \n China's central government has sought to distance itself from the origins of the disease, initially by sacking local officials blamed for allowing the virus to spread, and recently by supporting the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 originated in the United States.

A 66-year-old man from Wuhan, China tested positive to Covid-19 last month after staying at Shangri-La\u2019s Rasa Sentosa. \n A few weeks later, the couple felt confident in Singapore\u2019s ability to keep Covid-19 in check, and chose to keep up their romantic tradition. \n \u201cOur mindset is that, ironically, the places in Singapore right now with confirmed cases of the virus are actually the cleanest places, because so much effort has been spent to make sure that these places are now disinfected. So Sentosa is actually pretty ideal for us now,\u201d Ms Teo said. \n Mr Cheong said: \u201cMost Singaporeans my age that I know aren\u2019t really bothered by the outbreak. We don\u2019t wear facemasks when we head out, although we wash our hands more often.\u201d \n Ms Teo added: \u201cI guess going ahead with our Valentine\u2019s Day plan is my way of actively choosing not to let the virus affect my life any further than it should.\u201d \n In the same way, Mr Chua Kok Teng, 44, is undeterred by the Covid-19 outbreak from taking his wife out to dinner tonight. \n But instead of dining in a restaurant at Dempsey Hill or Tanjong Pagar like they usually do on Valentine\u2019s Day, the couple will spend this year\u2019s occasion supping on ma la hot pot at an open air eatery. \n \u201cWe have never had ma la together, so my wife chose a place near our home in Clementi,\u201d said Mr Chua, who is an engineer in the oil and gas industry. The pair do not drive, and decided to eat close to where they live in order to avoid taking transport to town. \n Other couples whom TODAY spoke to also had the Covid-19 outbreak in the back of their minds when planning for their Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations. \n For their first Valentine\u2019s Day together, Ms Angie Ching, 22, a student at Singapore Institute of Management, and her boyfriend Mr Tan Jun Xiong, 23, will be taking a long bus ride instead of their originally-planned MRT trip to their dinner spot at Bendemeer, in a bid to minimise the number of people they come in close contact with. \n Ms Ching reasoned that a bus typically has fewer passengers than a train. \n The lovebirds also initially wanted to spend the entirety of Saturday together , but decided to just have lunch and a karaoke session that day instead. \n Ms Ching said she felt sad and upset when she first feared they would have to scrap their romantic evening, as the duo have barely had time to be alone with one another in the last month due to the Chinese New Year celebrations and Mr Tan working on weekdays. \n Now that they elected to continue with most of their plans since they believe the outbreak situation here is under control, Ms Ching said: \u201cI feel excited but a little wary, because the virus is still here in Singapore, and we have to stay vigilant and extra careful.\u201d \n Mr Tan, who is working as an accountant while waiting for his university term to start, told TODAY: \u201cLife still goes on, as long as we take care of ourselves and take a little more precaution during this period of time, then there\u2019s no need to make it seem as though the world has stopped.\u201d \n \u201cAlso, it\u2019s our first Valentine\u2019s together, a day where couples celebrate their love for each other. Why would we want to miss this?\u201d \n Another couple, Mr Gareth Yeo, 33, who works as an IT specialist, and his wife Ms Sharon Yu, 32, a nurse working in a general hospital ward, will be spending most of their Valentine\u2019s Day at home, making popiah for lunch, catching an afternoon movie on the sofa and having a quiet dinner at a restaurant in Sembawang. \n However, the reason they chose to remain indoors was not out of fear they might catch Covid-19, but rather because they felt that Ms Yu needed some extra rest. \n After working almost non-stop for the past seven days as part of her shift schedule, Ms Yu said it was a coincidence that one of her off-days fell on Valentine\u2019s Day, and it was the perfect opportunity for her to spend time with her husband. \n \u201cWhen I\u2019m on night shift, I don\u2019t get to see him at all, because he comes home at 7.30pm and I leave at 7pm, and when I come back in the morning he is already off to work,\u201d she said. \n Mr Yeo, who took a leave day on Friday to be with his wife, planned the whole day for them both. \n \u201cIt feels like she was gone for a very long time, and now she\u2019s back. She\u2019s been very focused on her work for the past few days, and she\u2019s simply had no time for other activities besides sleep, work, and cooking some simple meals,\u201d he said. \n \u201cI think she deserves some time to unwind after having such hectic working days,\u201d he added. \n One couple refused to let Covid-19 alter their Valentine\u2019s Day arrangements at all. \n Mr Yuen, 60, and Mrs Yuen, 58, who wish to be known only by their surnames, said that while their Valentine\u2019s Day plans were simple, they would still continue with them as planned. \n \u201cI\u2019m not overly concerned, we just have to make sure we take the necessary precautions. So we won\u2019t have any changes in our plan,\u201d said Mr Yuen, who works as group head of engagement and programs at the Centre for Fathering. \n The couple have been married for 31 years with three grown children, and will be going out on Saturday evening for vegan food, which they said they have been experimenting with recently. \n Mrs Yuen, who is a project manager, said: \u201cWe usually take time off and do dinner, but our objective is to connect with one another. We are not so concerned about the flowers and champagne.\u201d \n \u201cWe believe that a relationship isn\u2019t just about Valentine\u2019s Day. If you make time for each other, every day can be Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d she added. \n Mr Chua said: \u201cNaturally I am very worried about the outbreak. But I guess ultimately if we stick to the basic rules for personal hygiene, there will be many couples who can just have their usual Valentine\u2019s Day programme.\u201d \n \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s never a 100 per cent guarantee that you will be safe, and you can only worry so much. I guess you just have to strike a balance.\u201d "}, {"content": "Covid-19. PM Spanish appeals to the political unit to combat pandemic.

Exempted from the prohibition, Australian citizens and people with permanent residence permit and their relatives, said Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Foreign Ministry has exacerbated its travel instructions for China and recommends australians now to give up traveling to China.\nThe ban on entry is now implemented by the border authorities, announced Morrison. The travelers exempt from the ban would have to go to the country in their return to a two-week \"self-quarantine\", he said. This means that Morisson follows the example of the US government, which had already imposed a similar entry ban a day before. The exceptions to the US ban are the same as the Australian regulation, also the USA gave a travel warning.\nThe Chinese government had criticized the US because of the travel ban. She witness \"certainly not of goodwill,\" said a speaker of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While the World Health Organization (WHO) had advised by travel restrictions, the US would have \"overruned the opposite way\".\nThe \"words and actions of certain US representatives\" do not correspond to the facts or be \"reasonable\". Criticism had also confessed US commercial minister Wilbur Ross. As the New York Times reports, he said in an interview with the sender Fox Business, the outbreak of the virus could help to relocate jobs in China back to the United States. Companies would need to comply with the virus when planning their supply chains.\nThe WHO had proclaimed the international health nightstand because of the virus. Connected, above all, is the publication of concrete recommendations for action to all countries to curb the virus. WHO General Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had emphasized in the announcement of the decision, it is not a \"mistrust vote\" against China. Travel and trade restrictions are not necessary.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by Coronaviren who have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example.\nIn China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help.\nMeanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThat can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS.\nAustralia had reported the first three coronaviruses last Saturday, the number of infected in the country is nine. In total, just under 12,000 cases have been registered worldwide. The number of suspected cases is over 15,000, died 259 people, all of them in China. Overall, the virus has spread to 27 countries, outside China has so far more than a hundred people have been affected.\nIn Germany, seven people have infected with the virus. At least six of them are in good condition according to doctors, for a case there has been no information yet. A machine of the Air Force, which is to return more than a hundred Germans from Wuhan, has already started and will arrive at Frankfurt Airport am Main Airport. According to Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, none of the Germans flipped out of China is infected.

Authorities have also reprimanded tech firms that gave free rein to online speech.\n\u201cXi Jinping has made it clear that he expects efforts to strengthen \u2018the guidance of public opinion\u2019 to be increased,\u201d said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen around 300 more journalists dispatched to Wuhan and surrounding areas to report on the outbreak. It\u2019s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government\u2019s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.\u201d\nThe cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to phone calls or to requests for comment sent by fax.\nChina\u2019s censorship machine was tested last week when Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about coronavirus, died of the disease, triggering widespread outrage as well as mourning.\nOnline media outlets were permitted to report on Li\u2019s death, but not the anger it had engendered, and early discussions on social media calling for the Wuhan government to apologise to him later disappeared.\nA notice sent to editors working for an online Chinese news outlet and seen by Reuters asked them not to \u201ccomment or speculate\u201d on Li\u2019s death, \u201cdo not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.\u201d\nSarah Cook, the China media bulletin director at Freedom House, said that previous crises had also seen brief windows of openness, such as the deadly 2011 crash of a high-speed train and the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when domestic journalists and social media users felt emboldened.\n\u201cAt the same time, initially, officials might be a bit flat-footed and distracted dealing with an unexpected crisis so things slip through the cracks. Even censors within some social media companies may be sympathetic to some of the content and let it through,\u201d she said.\nThe brief window of media freedom came after officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, admitted that it was much worse than anticipated and were heavily criticised for their move in January to reprimand eight people for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d on the emergence of the virus - one of whom was Li.\nLast week, however, CAC announced that it had punished some websites, mobile applications and social media accounts for publishing illicit content on the outbreak, saying it wanted to foster a \u201cgood online atmosphere\u201d amid the country\u2019s efforts to contain the epidemic.\nA notice circulated by CAC last week that was seen by Reuters asked audio and video platforms to step up control on \u201charmful information and rumour\u201d related to Wuhan virus.\nIt also asked them to stick to official media such as Xinhua and People\u2019s Daily, \u201cnot to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.\u201d\nSome investigative articles published by local media outlets from Wuhan have also been deleted.\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was sending dispatches from Wuhan over Twitter - which is blocked in China - including images of corpses in the city\u2019s hospitals, has been forcibly put under quarantine since Friday, according to his family and a friend managing his account in his absence.\nMany Chinese Internet users have turned to black humour or shared images, songs and other art forms in private WeChat groups to express their dismay. One phrase widely shared mocked how many Internet pages and content were now showing \u201cserver not found\u201d or \u201c404\u201d.\n\u201c404+404+404+404+404=2020,\u201d said the shared post.

The impact of SARS-COV-2, commonly known as the new coronavirus, in the cinema industry is leading to immediate breaks in the ticket results and estimates of losses that can amount to EUR 4.5 billion throughout the world, but especially with focus on Asia.\nThe accounts are of analysts quoted by Hollywood Reporter magazine, which estimate that losses can ascend or even exceed - the largest worldwide exhibition market, the US, is also a victim of the influence - EUR 4,5 billion. The main damages are mainly related to the exhibition of cinema in the countries most affected by coronavirus, and that in some cases they are even from the most important markets in the world. There is no time limit to regularize the situation as regards the decisions of companies and authorities, or for the confidence of some viewers to return.\nThe countries most affected by the abrupt decrease in the number of spectators are China (second largest market in the world), South Korea (fifth largest market in the world), Italy or Japan (third largest market in the world). In addition to, in the entertainment world, there are digessions of songs postponed for their Asian portions or promotional or press events that go to Skype or web conference sessions, theaters closure, viewers' escape and cancellation of debut In the important Chinese or South Korean markets are having a direct impact on the movies.\nIn China there are 70,000 cinemas closed and no forecasting reopening for the coming months. A gigantic break in the ticket results is palpable in the numbers: Variety magazine cites data from the comscore film analyst showing how in the first two months of 2020 the Chinese ticket office profited only 214 million euros (raw results) against the 1,8 EUR 1 billion that had embedded in 2019. Only last month, that of the Chinese New Year and the one in which the outbreak of Cuvid-19 became known, revenues went from EUR 1.5 billion in 2019 for mere 4 , 2 million euros this year.\nIn South Korea the loss is 70% compared to last year. \"Cinemas are open, but more would be worthless,\" says a distributor under anonymity to Hollywood Reporter. \"The situation is much worse than what we have seen during the Mers outbreak in 2015 [the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East - Mers-COV]. At the time there was a public break of more than 40% but there were no closed cinemas and the market resurrected past one month, \"says the same publication of the South Korea's Film Commission. Specters tend to avoid the rooms at a time in that there are already more than 4800 cases in the country, where for example the debut of a black-and-white version of parasites, the South Korean film that historically snatched the \u00d3scars this year , has been delayed.\nIn Japan (980 confirmed cases this Tuesday) is estimated that there is a break from 10 to 15% in Box Office. Already in Italy, the greatest European focus of the new disease, only last weekend the affluence to the Italian cinemas fell 75% in relation to the same weekend of 2019, for example. This week in Italy there are about 850 screens without working - the total in the country is 1830, recalls Variety. The premiences of some American films were postponed.\nAlso in China the premises of Americans for the next few weeks and months are suspended: Mulan's debuts were postponed, 007: No time to die, Dolittle, 191, Jojo Rabbit, Sonic the film; In South Korea, the premiere of Bora there, from Pixar, is also undatected. The postponement of concurrent global premiences, namely failing the important Chinese market, increases the risk of piracy and additional loss of revenue.\nLooking for the future is difficult thing for already. In the Chinese capital, for example, the Directives of the Disease Prevention and Control Center and the Municipal Cinema Cabinet, which since 26 February obliges authorities to prepare the entry into operation of theaters. To reopen it is necessary only to be sold tickets in alternating queues and only the viewers who identify. Each room should be deeply disinfected shortly after a session and before the following.\nAs for filming, recalls Variety, if the teams are less than 50 people, they are almost automatically authorized to film in Beijing since the body temperature of workers did not exceed the 37 degrees centigrade and that all (except actors) use masks. Larger teams are still forbidden to work. \"Looking at the current situation, the cinema industry is not equipped to resume work,\" admits Chen EIB, deputy secretary general of Beijing's municipal government. Among the movies that are suspended is the next Jia Zhang-ke project, as the director said to the IndieWire site, whose shooting is postponed Sine Die.\nSubscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.\nIn this field, and among the first professional victims of coronavirus impact relief are the filming of the next mission: Impossible in Venice, suspended until nevelight.\nThe industry also resent on the purely negotiated side. The presence of Chinese buyers in audiovisual markets such as the MIPTV of this spring, similar to what has been done with the poor adherence of Chinese distributors at the last Berlin Film Festival, should be scarce and there may be important distribution agreements. With cancellations or postponements of events and fairs a little all over the world, from the Bologna Book Book Fair to the Paris Book Hall, Hollywood Reporter indicates that the Cannes Festival is still on top of the table and that the preparations for the Largest international cinema event continue, albeit attentive to \"developments and directives of authorities\".

PITTSBURG, Pennsylvania: Snakes \u2013 the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra \u2013 may be the original source of the newly discovered coronavirus that has triggered an outbreak of a deadly infectious respiratory illness in China this winter. \n The illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China, and has been rapidly spreading. Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States. \n Using samples of the virus isolated from patients, scientists in China have determined the genetic code of the virus and used microscopes to photograph it. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus. \n It\u2019s in the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years. \n The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\u00a0But there are many questions that need to be answered to curb the spread of this public health threat. \n THE DEADLY WUHAN CORONAVIRUS \n The name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope. \n Coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. \n Though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, SARS and MERS can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans. \n  \n This new 2019-nCoV causes similar symptoms to SARS and MERS. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response. \n Unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. \n A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease. \n THE PROBLEM WITH ZOONOTIC TRANSMISSIONS \n Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. \n This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans. \n Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. \n Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS and MERS is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans. \n In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalised were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry , donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. \n  \n However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market. \n The hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses. \n The study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. \n The authors further found that the RNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the \u201ccrown\u201d of the virus particle that recognises the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people. \n But when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes. \n FROM BATS TO SNAKES \n The researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favoured by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. \n Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes. \n Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. \n Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species \u2013 bats \u2013 to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. \n However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery. \n The authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. \n  \n However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus\u2019 source animal. \n Sampling RNA from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. Nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols. \n The 2019-nCoV outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Haitao Guo is Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh.

How do you know in the event that the pulmonary infection from China will also become an epidemic in Europe? The boss of the British Wellcome Trust, the world's two-riding foundation for the promotion of medical research, tweeted a few days ago: \"One thing that would help is to vaccinate against flu.\"\nFirst of all, that seems strange. Because a flu prototype does not protect against infection with the virus called 2019-NCOV, which spreads from the city of Wuhan since the turn of the year in China and across country borders. Located it has already been introduced to Europe. Also in Germany, a person has become infected with the pathogen.\nThe idea behind the call of Jeremy Farrar for flu vaccine was another: because the symptoms of a real flu (see box) and the lung disease triggered by the coronavirus may be similar at the beginning, influenza patients would quickly become corona in case of doubt. Suspected cases. With all the consequences that would have that. Also, they would then have to be isolated and tested for the pathogen they infected them. Last but not least, those affected would be offset in fear and terror. In this respect, milling vaccinations mitigued the pressure on the health system, which the new pathogens could develop, he should also lead to an epidemic. In short, the milder the flu, the fewer additional problems would have epidemics.\nThe flu, caused by the influenza virus, usually starts suddenly with fever, dry irritant cough, muscle and / or headache. Other symptoms can be general weakness, sweat eruptions, but also nausea / vomiting and diarrhea. The disease period is usually five to seven days.\nThe current influenza situation in Germany can be seen on the website of the working group Influenza.\nBy far, not all influenza infected illicit so typical.

They reach a low distance on the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract of healthy people.

"}, {"content": "Spanish hospitals anticipate\nUpon arrival of the Coronavirus. Form the emergency personnel and equip themselves with tools for rapid diagnosis of patients who can enter with the Wuhan Coronavirus. Thus, the large Spanish hospitals are prepared at the outbreak that stalks to China and that has reached nine other countries aboard international flights. It is not for now the case of Spain: The Ministry of Health reported this Friday that two cases suspected under study, people with respiratory ailments recently arrived from Wuhan, have given negative to the tests carried out. But at the last minute the Basque Country notified that they had a patient with some suspicious symptoms that she was under surveillance and that she had recently visited Wuhan.\n\"We are following everything with great interest, but also with tranquility. It is very unlikely that the new virus will become a relevant problem in Spain, \"says Santiago Moreno, head of the Service of Infectious Diseases of Ram\u00f3n and Cajal Hospital (Madrid). This position coincides with that maintained by the ministry. \"The population has to have a very low risk perception level,\" said Fernando Simon, director of the Health Alerts and Emergencies Coordination Center, in the presentation of measures agreed for health and autonomous communities.\nThree ideas are the most repeated by the specialists consulted by this newspaper. The first is that what is known about the virus is still little. \"We do not know the transmissibility rate, which tells us how many people contagiate each case. Nor do we know if there are asymptomatic cases or with very mild symptoms, \"explains Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Bath, head of the Service of Infectious Diseases of the Virgin Macarena Hospital (Seville).\nThe second is that, with the available data, Wuhan seems less virulent than the other Coronavirus who have caused epidemic outbreaks since 2002. \"Mortality does not reach 5%, while with SARS and MERS were very superior [10 % and 35%, respectively] \", affirms Juan Carlos Gal\u00e1n, spokesman for the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology (Seimc). In addition, \"although the transmission of person to person has been demonstrated, it does not seem very high, less than in SARS,\" adds Magda Campins, head of preventive medicine from the Vall d'Hebron Hospital (Barcelona).\nAs an important idea, experts conclude that, until investigations advance and international agencies establish more accurate recommendations, it is recommended to \"take here the necessary measures to be prepared if any case comes,\" says Jos\u00e9 Miguel Cisneros, head of service. of infectious diseases of the Virgen del Roc\u00edo hospital. \"And be calm, because our public health system and our hospitals are well prepared to deal with an episode like this,\" he adds.\nThe first measures adopted by hospitals go by \"preparing protocols for emergency personnel , which is the gateway to the hospital, \"says Campins. \"The goal is to determine if the patient suffers symptoms compatible with the virus and if she has recently traveled to Wuhan,\" he adds. If both facts coincide, \"the patient must be entered into isolated manner and the health personnel adopt the habitual precautionary measures until it is discarded or confirmed that the ailment is caused by the virus,\" Rodr\u00edguez Bathroom says. These measures go through \"Hand Protection and Respiratory Barriers, such as high-grade protection masks just as there was an aerial transmission,\" he adds.\nThe instructions that ultimate the Ministry of Health and the Autonomous Communities establish that the samples of all suspected patients will be sent to the National Microbiology Center (CNM), which will be the reference and will have the results by approximately one day. But large hospitals have a technology, called PCR, which allows the diagnosis to advance in very few hours. \"We are acquiring the specific kits to genetically identify the Wuhan virus with the PCR,\" Campins account. \"We have ordered the purchase and we will arrive on Monday,\" explain from Ram\u00f3n and Cajal.\nFernando Simon explained Friday that if a positive case is detected, contact tracking will be monitored, although the virus does not have \"a lot of transmissibility\". On a flight, for example, the evolution of the two passengers seated at his side would be followed. The objective is that the public network has the sensitivity to detect cases without blocking the health system. Health does not arise for now taking exceptional measures at airports, since there are no direct flights from Wuhan and is a measure \"that has not been utilized\", according to Simon. This explained that it is very frequent that passengers who come from long flights suffer respiratory symptoms, more in winter, so applying controls to arrivals \"would not contribute a sufficient benefit.\"\nHealth concludes that \"it is not very likely, but it can happen\" that the virus arrives in Spain. \"That is why we are prepared to act,\" explained Simon, who recalled that the most important thing in these outbreaks are the performances in origin and that he considers that quarantines in China reduce risk. "}, {"content": "chinese president xi jinping, under fire, says he led covid-19 fight early on. BEIJING \u2014 Under fire for its response to the coronavirus epidemic, China\u2019s authoritarian government appears to be pushing a new account of events that presents President Xi Jinping as taking early action to fight the outbreak that has convulsed the country. \n But in doing so, authorities have acknowledged for the first time that Mr Xi was aware of the epidemic and involved in the response nearly two weeks before he first spoke publicly about it \u2014 and while officials at its epicentre in the city of Wuhan were still playing down its dangers. \n That new account risks drawing the president, China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades, directly into questions about whether top officials did too little, too late. \n In an internal speech published Saturday, Mr Xi said he had \u201cissued demands about the efforts to prevent and control\u201d the coronavirus Jan 7, during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest council of the Communist Party, whose sessions are typically cloaked in secrecy. \n In the speech, he also said he had authorised the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning Jan 23. \n \u201cI have at every moment monitored the spread of the epidemic and progress in efforts to curtail it, constantly issuing oral orders and also instructions,\u201d Mr Xi said of his more recent involvement. \n Mr Xi\u2019s advisers may have hoped that publishing the speech, delivered Feb 3, would dispel speculation about his recent retreat from public view and reassure his people that he can be trusted to lead them out of the epidemic. The virus so far has officially infected more than 68,000 people and killed more than 1,650 worldwide, the vast majority in mainland China. \n \u201cThe overall tone of the speech appears to be defensive,\u201d said Dr Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. \u201cHe wants to change the narrative, which until this point has been very unfavourable to the top leadership.\u201d \n Delivered at a meeting with top party officials, when the epidemic had already spiraled into a national crisis, the speech could expose Mr Xi to criticism that he didn\u2019t treat the initial threat urgently enough and make it difficult for him to shift blame onto local officials for what many see as the government\u2019s early mishandling of the epidemic. \n The remarks also raise questions about what top leaders knew at the time and what instructions they issued based on that knowledge. \n That Mr Xi convened a meeting of China\u2019s highest political body in early January indicates that the coronavirus was already being seen as a matter of high-level concern \u2014 making his subsequent silence even more conspicuous, experts said. \n An official account of the Jan 7 Standing Committee meeting issued at the time by Xinhua, the state news agency, made no mention of a discussion of the coronavirus. \n \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s trying to indicate that \u2018We weren\u2019t asleep at the wheel,\u2019\u201d said Dr Jude Blanchette , the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cBut it comes off like, \u2018We knew this was a problem, but we weren\u2019t sounding the alarm.\u2019\u201d \n In the speech this month, Mr Xi signaled his displeasure with lower-level bureaucrats for their \u201cshortcomings\u201d in implementing the party\u2019s top-level directives. \n In early January, officials in Wuhan were giving open assurances that human-to-human transmission of the virus was unlikely. Some government experts agreed. \n \u201cFor now, it seems there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d Dr Xu Jianguo, a senior expert on communicable diseases at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview in early January with Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper. \u201cThis shows that the threat level from this virus is limited.\u201d \n The new information places Mr Xi\u2019s involvement in fighting the epidemic much earlier than was previously known. His earliest public comment on the epidemic came Jan 20, when he gave brief instructions that were published in state media. \n In the days after Mr Xi\u2019s Jan 7 orders were issued, politicians in Wuhan met for the annual meeting of the city\u2019s People\u2019s Congress, its party-controlled legislature. Over that time, the Wuhan health commission\u2019s daily bulletins on the outbreak said repeatedly that there were no new cases of infection, no firm evidence of human-to-human transmission and no infection of medical workers. \n But signs were growing that politicians and government experts underestimated the potency of the new coronavirus. On Jan 9, a 61-year-old man surnamed Zeng died \u2014 the earliest confirmed fatality from the virus. Already, some doctors in Wuhan hospitals were worried enough to warn friends and propose special wards for patients showing symptoms of infection. \n Even after Mr Xi made his first public remarks about the epidemic Jan 20, he mostly kept it at the bottom of his public agenda. On the day before the Chinese New Year holiday began in late January, he took the stage at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and declared his success in guiding China through a difficult year \u2014 making no mention of the virus that was already spreading fear throughout the country. \n In the days after, he all but disappeared from public view, emerging only a handful of times to preside over Communist Party meetings and to meet foreign visitors, including the director-general of the World Health Organization and Cambodia\u2019s autocratic leader, Mr Hun Sen. \n In the meantime, he directed China\u2019s No. 2 leader, Mr Li Keqiang, to lead the group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the response. \n For days, Mr Xi\u2019s absence from public view fueled speculation that he was trying to shield his own reputation by taking a back seat in the fast-unfolding crisis. In the past week, he has returned to centre stage in an apparent effort to swat away such talk. \n This past week, Mr Xi went to a neighbourhood centre in Beijing, a hospital and a centre for disease control in what state media billed as a visit to the \u201cfront line\u201d of China\u2019s efforts to combat the epidemic. He has yet to visit Hubei, the province at the centre of the epidemic. \n A few days later, Mr Xi fired two top Communist Party officials in Hubei, a move intended to calm simmering public anger and contain the political fallout. \n By publishing the Feb 3 speech now, experts said, Mr Xi appears to be staking his reputation on the outcome of the epidemic fight. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting in the speech is, there\u2019s a lot of the word \u2018I\u2019 in it,\u201d said Dr Blanchette, of Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThis is clearly putting himself at the centre of Beijing\u2019s response to this while also falling back on the old excuse of blaming cadres for long-standing pathologies of China\u2019s political system.\u201d \n The Feb 3 speech was published by Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, the Communist Party\u2019s top doctrinal journal. It is rare for such an internal speech to be published in full so quickly. THE NEW YORK TIMES "}, {"content": "Breakingviews - Breakdown: Coronavirus goes global. NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - It\u2019s not time to panic, but it is time to face reality. The coronavirus is spreading around the world. China\u2019s unprecedented efforts slowed the spread of the new disease officially known as Covid-19, but that\u2019s merely won some time. Infected people have now been detected on every continent except Antarctica. Competent and open government is the best defense against hospitals and society being overwhelmed. But nations will probably have to deal with recurring outbreaks.\nNo. China helped reduce transmission by shutting down public gatherings, factories, and schools. Mass testing is also key to figure out who has the disease, and track who may have been exposed. China now claims the number of new cases is falling. While the country\u2019s official statistics are notoriously unreliable, it makes sense such methods would slow the spread of the disease which has afflicted more than 78,000 people in the People\u2019s Republic and killed around 2,700.\nWhile the World Health Organization has declined to call it a pandemic \u2013 a deadly disease which is spreading worldwide \u2013 the cat is out of the bag. Cases have been found in 50 countries, and the list is rapidly growing. On Wednesday the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded those inside the country for the first time since the disease was identified in early December.\nWhat\u2019s especially alarming is that one of the first indications of a mass outbreak in Iran came from a traveler being diagnosed in Canada. If countries that appear uninfected are spreading the disease, many other outbreaks are presumably underway. Nearly every country neighboring Iran has now been affected.\nFor a disease to be truly worrisome, it needs to be both highly contagious and dangerous. Ebola has caused a lot of suffering in central Africa, but the disease often kills its victims before they can infect many others. The odds of it spreading widely are therefore low.\nBy comparison the 2009 flu \u2013 the last pandemic \u2013 spread all over the earth but was surprisingly mild. America\u2019s Centers for Disease Control estimates over 60 million Americans were stricken. It swamped medical offices, workplaces were short-staffed, and schools emptied. But it only killed about one out of every 5,000 people who were infected.\nThe new coronavirus appears to spread easily. The experience of the Diamond Princess cruise ship suggests it can be explosive. Out of 3,700 passengers and crew, there have been about 700 confirmed cases and that number continues to rise. More broadly, cases outside China are more than doubling every week. It\u2019s also dangerous. The estimated death rate for Covid-19 is about 2%, making it about 20 times deadlier than typical influenza.\nHealthcare systems aren\u2019t designed to deal with pandemics, because they are so unusual. The United States has about 900,000 hospital beds, about two-thirds of which are occupied on average according to the CDC. The World Health Organization estimates about 80% of coronavirus cases are mild , with others serious or critical. So if just 1% of America\u2019s population of 330 million contracted the virus at the same time, there wouldn\u2019t be enough hospital beds. An uneven outbreak could lead to more overcrowding in some cities and critical-care units.\nHospitals would probably run short of protective gear. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said the government has stockpiled 30 million masks, but it needs 300 million to protect front-line healthcare workers alone. Doctors would be overloaded, because many would become sick, and because people who have not been infected would still seek help.\nStretched medical systems will kill more patients. This dynamic helps explain why the death rate in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, has been higher than in other parts of China. Countries with poor medical care will be hit harder. They lack the ability to find clusters of disease and dampen the outbreak, while patients won\u2019t be treated.\nClosed factories and housebound consumers have already depressed Chinese economic activity. Companies ranging from Apple to Yum China have warned of supply chain issues and decreased demand. These will cascade as more countries embrace drastic measures. Japan on Thursday closed all its schools early ahead of an upcoming spring break.\nIt\u2019s notable that three of the four flu pandemics in the past century were followed shortly by U.S. recessions. The exception was the 2009 outbreak, which occurred when the world economy was already in the dumps. Closed factories and offices reduce output, restaurants and cinemas suffer revenue shortfalls, corporate debt weighs heavier, while small businesses may fail if the owner falls sick or dies.\nThe World Bank estimated in 2014 that a pandemic of similar size and effect to the 1918 flu would knock 5% off global gross domestic product. That disease was both widespread and probably more virulent \u2013 it killed over 50 million people \u2013 so that\u2019s a worst-case scenario.\nAllowing information to flow freely is the best way to identify clusters early. When local officials cover up, or doctors are afraid to disclose cases, outbreaks fester. The epidemics in China and Iran probably would have been caught and acted upon earlier in less authoritarian countries.\nMeasures such as shutting down society or closing borders can slow transmission, but can\u2019t be sustained for months on end. Democratic societies may not allow the kind of intensive surveillance China has practiced. Workers and businesses can only go so long before the financial crunch becomes unbearable. China is now revving back up, and that will almost certainly result in more infections.\nMass testing of the exposed and isolating the sick can be sustained and might keep clusters manageable. But this requires a functioning system with competent leadership. South Korea said on Wednesday that over 20,000 people were being tested. The United States has not started surveillance and has only been testing about a dozen people a day. That means undetected outbreaks are probably underway.\nPast pandemics have spread in waves. The virus may propagate more effectively when the weather is cold and dry. Behavior changes too; people wash their hands more often when evidence of sickness is around them. As the proportion of the population with immunity rises, the disease spreads more slowly. However, immunity may wane over time. The most likely outcome is that the disease becomes endemic with smaller outbreaks following the initial flare.\nSeveral anti-viral medicines and vaccines are already being tested. Showing efficacy, safety and scaling up production will take time, though. A drug to treat the coronavirus probably won\u2019t be widely available for at least a year; developing a vaccine will take longer. In the meantime, the world can only prepare for the worst, while hoping for the best. "}, {"content": "hundreds of americans flown home from cruise ship, 14 with coronavirus. SHANGHAI/TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. - More than 300 American cruise liner passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were flown home to military bases in the United States, after two weeks under quarantine off Japan.  \n The cruise ship Diamond Princess, with more than 400 cases by far the largest cluster outside China, has become the biggest test so far of other countries' ability to contain an outbreak that has killed 1,770 people in China and five elsewhere.  \n Ground crew in anti-contamination suits met a chartered jet that touched down at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and passengers could be seen climbing down the stairs wearing face masks in the pre-dawn mist. Another flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California hours earlier. Those arriving were taken into a two-week quarantine.  \n Although U.S. officials said passengers with coronavirus symptoms would not be taken, 14 passengers found at the last minute to have tested positive were permitted to board the planes. The U.S. State Department said the infected passengers were kept in isolation on the flights.  \n Across mainland China, officials said the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 2,048 to 70,548. That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.  \n Chinese authorities say the stabilisation in the number of new cases is a sign that measures they have taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.  \n However, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared. Official figures of new cases have levelled off in the past, only to jump suddenly after changes in methodology.  \n China has responded to the COVID-19 virus by locking down Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people, and imposing restrictions in a number of other cities.  \n But the ruling Communist Party is also under pressure to prevent the economy from crashing and get people back to work.  \n China's central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending, a move that is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.  \n Even so, economists expect China's economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody's on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.  \n  \n CRUISE SHIPS  \n Around half of all known cases of the virus outside China have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, where around 400 people have tested positive since the cruise liner was ordered to stay under quarantine off Japan on Feb. 3.  \n Several other countries have announced plans to follow the United States in bringing passengers home. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.  \n Matthew Smith , an American passenger who remained on the ship after refusing to board the voluntary repatriation flights, tweeted that staying behind was the \"best decision ever\".  \n \"US Gov't said they would not put anyone on the planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus,\" he wrote.  \n Authorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.  \n One American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.  \n Carnival Corp., which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace other passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.  \n \"Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,\" a statement from the company's Holland America Line unit said. Hundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.  \n \"We will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health,\" said passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. \"We have no idea when we get to get home.\"  \n  \n CHINA BACK TO WORK?  \n After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China needs to get back to work or suffer severe economic consequences. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.  \n Some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.  \n In Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.  \n Trade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recession is possible.

As of March 28, less than three months after the world was made aware of the novel coronavirus, 600,000 people across 177 countries/regions have been infected with it. The infection which reportedly originated from a market in Wuhan city in the Chinese province of Hubei, has claimed more than 27,800 lives.\nWith nations entering lockdown in an effort to 'flatten the curve' of social interactions by means of social distancing, it is very important to refrain from placing one's beliefs in any miraculous cures or conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Here are some widely shared myths about the novel coronavirus that stand nowhere on the scale of scientific relevance.\nThis is a myth. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that this infection can be transmitted in any and all areas regardless of climate.\nThis is not true. While wearing a mask in a crowded place is advisable, the mask cannot prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus. In some cases where the person wearing the mask touches an infected surface before touching his/her face to re-adjust the mask, this protective gear could lead to infection, said the Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria.\nThis is a myth. The normal body temperature remains stable between 36.5\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C despite the temperature of one's bath, says the WHO.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever to prove this claim. While alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a recommended precaution against any virus, drinking alcohol while seeking to cure Covid-19 is the same as drinking alcohol-based hand sanitizer and expecting it to taste like a pint of beer.\nIt has been established that the novel coronavirus jumped species from an animal to a man and is originally a zoonotic disease. However, no known animal species has been known to carry this virus as of yet and medical experts have asked people not to believe in rumours and eat non-vegetarian meals as long as they are prepared with utmost care for hygiene.\nThis is a myth. Dr Faheem Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland says that a person infected with the novel coronavirus can also hold his/her breath for longer than 10 seconds. On the other hand, the elderly will not be able to accomplish this task but it does not in any way mean that they are infected.\nDirector of AIIMS, Dr Randeep Guleria says that one should not visit a hospital during a pandemic since it increases the chances of a healthy person catching the virus. One should consult a doctor over the phone if he/she is experiencing any symptoms at all and seek future course of action.\nThis is a myth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the consumption of garlic boosts the immunity system or safeguards one from being infected with Covid-19.\nThis is untrue. One should not donate blood at a time like this unless and until one is absolutely sure that he/she is not infected.\nThis is a myth. No study or research has shown that mosquitoes can act as carriers of the novel coronavirus. \"The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose,\" says WHO.\nThese are myths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one should regularly wash one's hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Apart from this, neither a hand dryer nor an ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virus.\nThis is a myth. Pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine cannot protect anyone from Covid-19 since the vaccine for the new coronavirus is yet to be discovered.\nThis is untrue. While some preliminary research has shown that the novel coronavirus remains on certain surfaces such as cardboard for some time, it cannot spread through parcels received from China.\nThis is not entirely true. A thermal scanner detects body temperature and is great for identifying someone with a high fever, however, medical experts and doctors treating Covid-19 patients have said that initial research shows how people who display no symptoms can also be infected with the virus.\nThis is untrue. The transmission of novel coronavirus has been seen in people of all ages. Doctors suggest that people with co-morbid conditions such as blood pressure, heart or respiratory diseases are at a higher risk if they get infected with Covid-19. However, a perfectly healthy person can also be infected in the presence of a Covid-19 patient. "}, {"content": "novel coronavirus outbreak raises spectre of sars. Many have drawn parallels between the current novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2002 and 2003. \n It would be difficult not to. \n Both outbreaks are caused by novel animal coronaviruses that ended up infecting humans. Both originated in China, can cause severe human disease and have resulted in deaths. Both have been declared \u201cpublic health emergencies of international concern\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO). \n But there are significant differences between the two outbreaks and let\u2019s guard against seeing the 2019-nCoV from an old lens. \n First, let\u2019s consider why Sars is deeply entrenched in many Singaporeans\u2019 psyche. \n The Sars outbreak was a seminal event for Singapore and its healthcare system in particular. While the 238 cases and 33 deaths here between March and July 2003 may seem small when compared to most other serious medical conditions, Sars caused considerable fear and uncertainty among the people, with outsized economic and public health impact. \n These include the ramifications from the closure of Tan Tock Seng Hospital \u2014\u00a0a large general hospital \u2014\u00a0to non-Sars patients for almost three months. \n Then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong described the Sars epidemic as a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for Singapore. \n While WHO had praised Singapore for its exemplary handling of the epidemic, the outbreak also highlighted how unprepared our country was for a novel respiratory virus outbreak. \n In its aftermath, fundamental changes to hospitals and outbreak management in our country were made that have been extensively described elsewhere. \n As a result, Singapore is now far more prepared for 2019-nCoV and other epidemics compared to 2003. \n The collective psychological impact and institutional memory of Sars has meant that we have a tendency to view each new epidemic through the lens of the Sars experience. \n When the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus appeared on the horizon in April 2009, the initial planning in Singapore that I could observe revolved around containing the disease \u2014\u00a0early detection of infected persons for hospitalisation and prolonged isolation, as well as quarantining their contacts. \n This was triggered when the first patient in Singapore was diagnosed in May 2009. \n However, the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus \u2014\u00a0like all influenza viruses \u2014\u00a0is a markedly different beast compared to the Sars coronavirus (Sars-CoV). \n It spreads far more easily in the community, and poses a far lower risk of death. \n Fewer than one per thousand will die after being infected by influenza compared to slightly more than one in 10 persons infected with Sars. \n What this means is that pandemic influenza could never have been contained in Singapore, but the consequences of failing was not dire. \n The Ministry of Health (MOH) stepped down control measures for the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus over a short few months and changed its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition alert level to green (normal) in February 2010 , by which time an estimated several hundred thousand had been infected by flu. \n Doctors and public health professionals also believe the influence A (H1N1)pdm09 virus caused more deaths than Sars. \n Did the initial measures slow down the spread of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in Singapore sufficiently so that the healthcare system was not overwhelmed and people had time to be socialised to the idea that the pandemic was not worse than the usual seasonal flu? \n We do not know the answers to these questions. \n Fast forward to today, and it is clear now that there are crucial differences between Sars and the current coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan as well. \n During its approximate nine-month course, Sars infected 8,096 persons \u2014\u00a05,327 in mainland China \u2014\u00a0and resulted in 774 deaths. \n A significant proportion of its spread occurred in hospitals (40.8 per cent in Singapore). Within a third of that time, the 2019-nCoV has infected as of Feb 3 over 16,000 persons \u2014\u00a0more than 98 per cent of whom are in China \u2014\u00a0and resulted in over 300 deaths. \n Almost the entirety of its spread has been in the community. Part of the heightened case count is due to timing. \n The Wuhan outbreak occurred just before Chinese New Year, a period where the largest human migration on earth occurs. \n The world is also far more connected today than in 2003. However, it is also apparent now that the novel coronavirus is more infectious\u00a0than the Sars-CoV, with several family or travel clusters among those diagnosed overseas. \n Asymptomatic infections have been reported, which did not happen with Sars-CoV, with Germany reporting a plausible case of asymptomatic transmission of the virus. \n The silver lining is that the 2019-nCoV appears far less deadly compared to the Sars-CoV. \n The case fatality rate of the 2019-nCoV is currently estimated to be around 2 per cent (i.e. 2 out of every 100 infected will die), although the actual figure might be lower depending on the number of persons with mild disease who did not present to a healthcare facility and were thus undiagnosed. \n So currently the 2019-nCoV is shaping up to look less like Sars-CoV, and more like a virulent form of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, although more data is required before we can be completely certain. \n One important lesson is that the initial information obtained at the start of epidemics is incomplete and can be misleading. \n In early January 2020, there was little to suggest that the 2019-nCoV was different from the Sars and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses in terms of how it spreads and the severity of infection. \n Similarly, the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus\u00a0was initially believed to be as deadly as the Spanish flu of 1918, which was estimated to have wiped out between 3 and 5 per cent of the human population. \n Within a few short weeks, however, sufficient information became available for a more concrete re-assessment in both 2009 and 2020. \n We do not know at present whether the 2019-nCoV epidemic can be contained. \n China has instituted incredible control measures \u2014\u00a0in effect virtually quarantining an entire province \u2014\u00a0that would be unthinkable anywhere else in the world. \n However, the virus has already spread to more than 25 countries worldwide, including several that will not be able to mount as robust a response as China and other high-income countries should community spread occur. \n It is likely that the threat of 2019-nCoV will be present far longer than the nine months of Sars, while an effective vaccine will take far longer than a year to become commercially available. \n It is useful to look at the 2019-nCoV outbreak not through the lens of Sars, but entirely on its own characteristics and calibrate measures and policies towards minimising impact and living life as normally as possible during this period. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR:\u00a0\u00a0 \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang heads the Infectious Diseases Programme and is co-director of the Leadership Institute for Global Health Transformation at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore.

A black swan is walks through Asia and its global impact should still be determined. The Wuhan Coronavirus is an example of an unexpected event manual that affects health and economics. Protein consumption in emerging countries has skyrocketed as its economy and standard of living have grown. The interaction between animal viruses and human diseases as well. A known risk, but unfortunately increasingly frequent. It may be fried, but there is also a risk that it becomes a world pandemic. The most similar previous experience was that of the SARS virus in 2002-2003. Since then, the mechanisms of prevention and reaction to sanitary alerts throughout Asia have improved. In countries such as South Korea, I have been able to appreciate personally a few days ago that, even though the incidence is almost null, public messages in networks and sanitary measures are considerable.\nWhat is now managed is a significant uncertainty that already has a significant negative economic impact. To date, the consequences of this type of events have not been extended beyond a few months. It is not a great relief, in any case, because if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic, the effects can be serious at a time of a certain decay. The resistance of a weak global economy by 2020 goes through the evolution of the Chinese economy and coronavirus does not help. The first reflections are already appreciated. They have come for the price of crude. The fall in demand - among other issues for lower industrial activity and land and air traffic in China - reduced the price of Brent barrel by 6% only last week.\nBrackets value and volatility indexes have not yet reacted to these fears appreciably. But in the market analysis forums the risk of contagion is in all the mouths. If this and other geopolitical hazards - such as tensions with Iran - are no more reflected in markets it is because these are more pending from central banks. The laxity of monetary policy seems to have diminished the ability to issue warning signs.\nIf you reach a pandemic, the experience dictates that the values \u200b\u200bof emerging companies could be affected, with falls of up to 20%. SARS took the lives of 800 people and had an estimated cost of 50,000 million dollars. There are already more than 40 million Chinese citizens isolated but some analysts fear that this protection circle has arrived late. It has been revived from the discussion in the medical community about whether the mass use of antibiotics on animal farms is having a negative effect on human immunity levels. In favor of avoiding pandemic extension plays improvement in prevention mechanisms. Contrary, that this virus takes five days to manifest its symptoms and that on its origin there is hypotheses, but not yet an official confirmation. "}, {"content": "explainer: why are malaria pills being used against coronavirus?. Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective. Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION?  \n There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group. It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Bayer AG have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums.  \n \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information centre at Arizona-based Banner Health.

The time the local government was slow to transmit the data it had already been sufficient for that of the city to leave at least five million people before the isolation has been decreed, which may have contributed to the virus to spread throughout the country. Xianwang also confessed that the transmission was being made between people and not through bacteria or other means.\nWith the revelation made this Monday to Chinese state television, the autarian concluded that the only way out was to put office in hand. The same made the Secretary of the Communist Party of China in Wuhan, Ma Guoqiang. \"Our names will live in infamy, but as long as it is beneficial to control the disease and people's lives and safety, Comrade Ma Guoqiang and I will assume any responsibility,\" he said.\nThe number of cases of infection in Wuahn increased by 50% only last weekend, which led the authorities to announce the construction of a second emergency hospital, with space for 1300 patients - the first opens on February 3 and will have Thousand beds. At this point, the accounts point to 81 dead and 2744 injured following infection with coronavirus.\nIn addition to the case of possible dismissal, the Chinese authorities have been criticized by Chinese citizens in social networks, especially because of the way it has been managed the outbreak of coronavirus. Many Chinese netizens were outraged at what they denounce is a series of errors that occurred during the above-mentioned press conference in which three local authorities participated.\nThe governor of the province of Hubei (where the city of Wuhan is located), Wang Xiaodong, was at the conference without using a mask, violating the rules that make its use obligatory in public spaces. Already the autarch Zhou Xianwang, at his side, remembered the mask, but used it on the contrary, which caused jokes in the Weibo social network, the Chinese twitter equivalent.\nThe President of the Chamber of Wuhan had already been strongly criticized for being authorized on January 18 and 19, a giant banquet for which 40,000 families were invited to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Critical comments are the exceptions in the middle of the censorship that the Chinese government continues to promote on the Internet, where they include publications eliminated from social networks, erased news or investigations by supposed \"false news\".

SHANGHAI:\u00a0The food market where China's deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. \n The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday (Jan 22) as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed 17 people\u00a0and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. \n Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat -\u00a0setting Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. \n A price list circulating on China's Internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game - 112 items in all. \n \"Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,\" said the price list for the vendor, \"Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses\". \n Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licenses, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. \n AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected. \n The Beijing News published a photo on Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n  \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n VIRUS 'SPILLOVER' \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy - like the civet or some rats or bats -\u00a0or for purported health benefits. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Program. \n Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n  \n \"Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,\" he said. \n \"It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of ... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases.\" \n Bats are thought to have spawned SARS, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n SARS was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following SARS, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to SARS, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram "}, {"content": "coronavirus cases in china's hubei fall for second day, apple and markets feel impact.

The camp has looked after us well. We have all become close friends. But the food is not what I am used to, says the 31-year-old medical student from Wuhan University, China. He and the 647 other Indians evacuated from Wuhan on January 30 and February 1 in two batches were released on February 19 after they tested negative for the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV). However, to avoid taking chances, each person has been home quarantined for an additional 14 days, with their respective district hospitals monitoring the situation. With over 80,239 cases worldwide and 2,700 deaths (as of February 26), the human cost of nCoV has been making headlines since December 2019, and no country wants to take the threat lightly. The virus was first identified as nCoV, then changed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and finally named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization.\nThe devastating effects of a virus pandemic are being felt all the more by the global community this time around, because of the visual outpouring from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. This is not a tragedy happening in a forgotten corner of the planet. It is unfolding in the heart of the world\u2019s largest economy. Footage of helpless residents not being able to come close to their own family and desperate foreigners begging to return to their home countries have been doing the rounds for over two months. In India, the impact of nCoV has been considerably small, with just three confirmed outbreaks in Kerala. All of whom have now recovered and are under medical supervision. The state has experienced virus outbreaks before and its health department began precautionary measures for nCoV even before they were implemented at a national level.\nIndia might have escaped nCoV, but given the worrying trend of virus outbreaks every few years, we need to ask do we have a system in place to handle a Wuhan-sized pandemic?\nThe burden of control and eradication of disease when it reaches alarming proportions does not fall entirely on a country\u2019s health system. It is supported by various other agencies. While in India, the ministry of health and family welfare is the nodal ministry handling biological and health emergencies, such crises also come under the purview of disaster management agencies, the ministry of home affairs and the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC). India has pioneered the Delhi Declaration on Emergency Preparedness\u2019 which identifies risks, implements disaster risk reduction measures and prepares and operationalises readiness for a broad range of disasters, including diseases and outbreaks, says Professor S.S.

The coronavirus outbreak has been very much in the news and, apart from its impact on public health and the economy, is\u00a0also affecting\u00a0investments. \n Investors should position their portfolio carefully and watch markets closely during this period. \n IMPACT ON STOCK MARKETS \n Concerns about the Covid-19 coronavirus\u00a0in various countries continue to roil the markets with a heavy dose of volatility, financial advisory firm ETF Database observed. \n British newspaper The Guardian reported that financial markets remain confident the crisis will soon blow over, as share prices have been rebounding because investors think the coronavirus can be contained. \n Yet, it also noted that Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to insurance company Allianz, thinks that the economic damage could be a black swan event equivalent to the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market. \n Black swan events is a term popularised by writer Nassim Taleb and based on a\u00a0saying that black swans did not exist (until they were discovered in the wild). \n They are events that come as a complete surprise, have profound consequences and are rationalised by people who never saw the crisis coming and who then say after the fact that it was glaringly obvious that there was trouble ahead.\u00a0 \n The epidemic in China caused by coronavirus Covid-19 and the infections spreading in other\u00a0countries have already become a black swan event for the Asia-Pacific tourism industry, business information company IHS Markit says. It could hit other sectors as well. \n MARKET FORECASTS \n While investors understandably want to know what to do at this time of uncertainty. financial advisory firm Evergreen Gavekal\u2019s adviser Arthur Kroebel says that it is a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d to come up with highly specific forecasts for the ultimate impact on Chinese, regional or global gross domestic product (GDP) given the uncertainties involved. \n If it does turn into a global pandemic, he said, global supply chains would face more disruption, commodity prices would fall more severely, and central banks would face pressure to offset the impact.\u00a0 \n Already, though, financial services firm ING expects that potential spreading of the virus across the globe could last until March or April and mark a new downside risk to the global economy in the first half of 2020. \n Investment bank JP Morgan said that the coronavirus remains in its early stages and \u201cis likely to worsen before getting better\u201d. \n Here in Singapore, DBS bank said that the outbreak has thrown the Singapore economy a curveball. \n Supply chain disruptions such as extended factory closures within China will have a significant impact on Singapore\u2019s manufacturing sector, for example, and consumer spending is expected to be dampened as residents take more precautionary actions in their daily lives. \n As a result, \u201cwe are downgrading our 2020 real GDP forecast to 0.9% (from 1.4%) in response to the potential impact. The concern is that the impact could be deeper than Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).\u201d \n Over in Hong Kong , The Guardian said that the economy risks being plunged deeper into recession as the outbreak wreaks havoc, with consumers panic-buying staple goods and airlines stopping flights.\u00a0  POSITION YOUR PORTFOLIO PROTECTIVELY \n Amid all these uncertainties, a key question for investors is how to position their investment portfolio well and prepare effectively for whatever the next several months may bring. \n \u201cWhen you don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr Ray Dalio, founder of hedge-fund giant Bridgewater Associates told MarketWatch, \u201cthe best investment strategy is to be smartly diversified across geographic locations, asset classes, and currencies.\u201d \n So far, he said, \u201cfears of the spreading coronavirus have triggered a \u2018flight-to-quality\u2019 that continues to pressure stocks while giving a lift to hedges such as gold, bonds and the (US) dollar.\u201d \n British financial research firm Trustnet similarly said that some investors have started taking more defensive positions, with government bonds and gold being preferred options. \n For stocks, it could be advantageous to avoid vulnerable companies in the tourism sector such as airlines and cruise lines or hotels and to buy companies such as e-commerce or food delivery firms that will benefit even if consumers stay at home. \n Investors can also benefit by taking advantage of shifts in the market. \n While JPMorgan Chase analysts noted that previous global health scares such as Sars and Zika did not unsettle equities for an extended period, the MSCI Hong Kong index lost about 9 per cent during the Sars epidemic and then jumped17 per cent in the three months after the disease faded from view. \n Investment brokerage Schwab similarly said that although there is always a chance that this outbreak could have greater consequences, the global economy and markets have been relatively immune to the effects of past viral epidemics. \u201cA short-term dip in stocks tended to be followed by the continuation of the upward trend,\u201d it said. \n While there is uncertainty about the impact on investments and a panicked rush to buy less risky assets is not appropriate, investors would be well-advised to examine their portfolio and ensure that it is sufficiently diversified. \n Given the uncertainties, it could also be advisable to take a more defensive posture than usual over the next several months and increase the allocation to investments in bonds while reducing the allocation to stocks and potentially shifting the types of stocks in the portfolio. \n Even though the timing of an upturn is uncertain, watching trends and taking advantage of dips to buy if markets rebound could also be beneficial.

"}, {"content": "Singapore banks to see loan growth rate halved this year from coronavirus: Fitch Solutions. SINGAPORE - Singapore banks' loan growth will slow to 1.5 per cent in 2020, down from 3.1 per cent last year, given the stiff economic headwinds facing Singapore from the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, Fitch Solutions Macro Research forecast in a report released on Friday (Feb 14). \n The likelihood of a more pronounced slowdown is likely to weigh on credit demand, with businesses across a broad range of sectors including retail, tourism and the export-oriented manufacturing sector, likely to encounter tougher conditions as a result of the cornavirus epidemic around the world, said the research firm. It nopted that Singapore banks have already been contending with a contraction in consumer loan growth. \n Furthermore, likely monetary easing from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) would prevent interest rates from falling too far to offset lower credit demand, it said. \n Fitch Solutions said that while interest rates would normally fall in order to adjust to lower credit demand, Singapore is likely to undergo monetary easing in 2020 in a bid to support the economy, especially the exporting sectors, limiting the extent to which this is possible. \n Unlike other countries which use interest rates as the policy lever, Singapore uses the exchange rate instead. Easing monetary policy under such a system tends instead to have an upward effect on interest rates as they would adjust to maintain the attractiveness of assets denominated in the Singapore dollar, all other things equal. Therefore, as the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) rises in tandem with a weaker Singapore dollar, banks will find it hard to lower their rates significantly to bolster credit demand, further weighing on loan growth. Sibor is a key benchmark rate to price most home loans here. \n Its report comes a day after DBS flagged\u00a0the risks to its earnings from the virus outbreak as it announced quarterly and full-year results.. CEO Piyush Gupta said that if\u00a0the outbreak\u00a0is controlled by the summer,\u00a0 the hit to\u00a0revenue could be\u00a01 to 2 per cent.\u00a0OCBC and United Overseas Bank are set to announce their results on Feb 21. \n Fitch Solutions observed that loan growth last year was due to a recovery in lending to businesses that began in April 2019, in line with Singapore's stronger economic performance towards the latter half of 2019. But consumer loans (around 40 per cent of total loans) remained in contraction last year, mostly a reflection of the cooling property market and by extension, slower mortgage growth. \n However, the recovery in business loans (around 60 per cent of all loans) is unlikely to be sustainable in 2020 given that Singapore's open economy is heavily exposed to the likely deeper slowdown in the Chinese economy from the Covid-19 outbreak, said Fitch Solutions. It has revised down China's 2020 real GDP growth to 5.6 per cent from 5.9 per cent. \n \"As a result, our current 2020 real GDP growth forecast of 1.7 per cent for Singapore is exposed to heavy downside risks, and we will revisiting this figure over the coming weeks,\" said the firm. \n The report also noted that Singapore's export-oriented manufacturing sector is closely tied to those of China's economy and that the outbreak will hit a sector already weakened by the ongoing US-China trade war and the slowdown in China. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports posted 12 straight months of contraction at an average pace of 10.8 per cent year on year between December 2018 and November 2019, it calculated. \n It also said the tourism and related hospitality and retail sectors in Singapore will take a hit, not just from the plunge in Chinese visitors, who make up 18.5 per cent of arrivals here, but also as the climbing infection toll in Singapore and the Orange outbreak response level likely deters visitors from other countries as well. \n Fitch Solutions is part of the Fitch Group, which also comprises credit rating agency Fitch Ratings.

SINGAPORE \u2014 Aviation and tourism-related stocks in Singapore tanked on Monday (March 16) as investors reacted to additional travel restrictions imposed by the Singapore Government over the weekend in a bid to slow the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Analysts say the death knell was the extension of the restrictions to travellers from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), which are Singapore's closest neighbours \u2014 and include some of the world\u2019s busiest air routes. \n It was a bloodbath for the Straits Times Index (STI) on Monday, with aviation and tourism stocks particularly hard hit. It came amid massive selloffs on stock markets around the world as fears over the economic impact of Covid-19 verge on full-blown panic. \n Singapore Airlines slumped 6.34 per cent to end the day at S$6.74, a more than 15-year low. SIA last traded at this level in October 2004. Genting Singapore, which owns Resorts World Sentosa among other leisure industry properties, slid by 5.88 per cent to S$0.64. \n Far East Hospitality Trust dived 10.38 per cent to S$0.48, while CDL Hospitality Trust sank 10.71 per cent to close the day at S$1. \n Both counters are business trusts that have hotels in their portfolios. \n The STI, as a whole, lost 5.25 per cent, ending the day at 2,495.7 points. \n On Sunday, the Government announced that all travellers entering Singapore with recent travel history to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom in the previous 14 days will be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice. \n Singaporeans are also advised to defer all non-essential travel abroad with immediate effect, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. \n About 40 per cent of international arrivals into Changi Airport are from Asean countries, almost four times more than Chinese travellers, said Mr Paul Chew, head of research at Phillip Securities. \n Asean comprises Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar and Singapore. \n \u201cBy default, half of the business disappeared overnight. It\u2019s quite devastating,\u201d he said. \n In 2019, three flight routes within Asean were among the world\u2019s top five busiest flight routes of the whole year, according to travel data provider OAG. \n The Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route topped the list at 30,187 flights, while the Singapore-Jakarta route came in third at 27,046 flights. \n The Kuala Lumpur-Jakarta route took fifth spot at 19.741 flights every year. \n Already, Singapore has progressively banned travellers from China, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, South Korea and Spain from entering the country. \n These newest restrictions on Asean nationals, would \u201ckill a lot of business travel\u201d, said Mr Terence Wong, founder of Azure Capital. \n \u201cMost of them are intra-Asean travel, probably just in the country a day or two right? There is no reason why you want to be subjected to a 14-day stay-at-home requirement,\u201d he said. \n Ms Pan Jingyi, market strategist at IG, said that the market selloff is not just due to restrictions imposed in Singapore. \n Australia and New Zealand, which are destinations close to Asean, have also put up restrictions as part of their containment efforts. \n \u201cThere is a consolidated effort across the board,\u201d she said. \n Yet while the market is down dramatically, analysts to whom TODAY spoke said investors should exercise caution and not rush in just because share prices look very cheap. \n While Asian countries, such as Singapore, are generally perceived to be doing a better job at containing the Covid-19 outbreak, Ms Pan noted that financial markets here are still influenced externally, particularly with what\u2019s going on in the United States. \n Over the past week, financial markets in the US have suffered whiplash, rising and falling dramatically \u2014 but the net movement is a huge dive, from above 29,000 points in mid February to just above 22,000 in early trading on Monday. \n Last Thursday, the US market suffered its single largest percentage fall \u2014 9.5 per cent \u2014 since Oct 19, 1987 when the US market lost 25 per cent in a single session. \n \u201cThe outlook for the US market in the short-term, and I mean in the next one month, the outlook is not so positive. I don\u2019t recommend trying to catch this falling knife at this point in time,\u201d said Ms Pan. \n Mr Wong also warned not to jump into the market as there might be more downside risk in the future. \n However, Mr Chew said it is a good time to buy though his advice would be to pace the investments as the situation is still deteriorating. \n \u201cThe market will remain weak until we reach a peak in the number of new patients\u2026 Whenever the numbers rise, the market will take it that the detrimental economic impact will be more entrenched,\u201d he said. \n \u201cThe positive side is we see that the virus can be contained but at the cost of huge economic damage.\u201d "}, {"content": "What if the Virus Africa reaches?

Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei province, is the epicenter of the disease.\nThe two planes in Wednesday\u2019s airlift arrived at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, where 178 passengers from one plane disembarked to begin two weeks of round-the-clock health screening while barred from contact with the general public.\nNone of the group showed signs of disease, except for a small child who developed a fever during the flight and was taken to a nearby hospital with its mother for further testing and medical treatment in isolation, officials said. The other evacuees at Travis will be housed in a hotel on base.\nAfter refueling, the second evacuation plane flew on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, arriving with 167 passenger. Of that group, three adults and a child \u201cwere determined to have a fever or a cough that warranted them being transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,\u201d the CDC said. The rest were placed under quarantine at two housing sites on base.\n\u201cBecause these individuals were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where there is intense and escalating community-wide spread of this novel coronavirus, we consider them at high risk of exposure,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cWe are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,\u201d Braden told reporters during a briefing at Miramar.\nHe stressed that the CDC\u2019s strategy of early detection and containment of individuals who are sick or at high risk of exposure has been successful in preventing widespread transmission in the United States so far.\n\u201cIf there were ongoing community spread of this virus we would know it, and that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Braden said. \u201cSo right now, in the United States, communities across this country are at very low risk of being exposed to this virus, including in San Diego and including on this base.\u201d\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 500 people, most in and around Wuhan, and infected more than 28,000.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. The latest patient, reported in Wisconsin on Wednesday, is isolated at home and \u201cdoing well,\u201d the state health agency said in a statement.\nAs with nine other U.S. cases documented to date, that person fell ill after traveling to China and was exposed to known cases there, the state health department said.

Americans who traveled elsewhere in mainland China are subject to two weeks of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China will be directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers will be screened by the CDC.\nThe State Department also has issued a \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d advisory warning U.S. citizens against visits to China.

When the severe acute respiratory (Sars) epidemic ended in 2003, many people in China thought that the government had learned its lesson. \n Sars was the most serious epidemic the country encountered in the reform era, killing 349 people in China. \n The government was roundly criticised for its cover-ups in the early phases of the epidemic, leading to some frantic bureaucratic reshuffles, greater transparency and an expensive control and prevention system for infectious diseases. \n In March 2019, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Gao Fu confidently predicted that China would never again suffer from another Sars-like epidemic. \n Mr Gao is facing a storm of anger for this prediction since the outbreak in December 2019 of new coronavirus Covid-19, which has caused infections and deaths than Sars. \n As of March 7, according to the World Health Organization, Covid-19 has caused 3,073 deaths and infected 80,813 people in China, with hundreds of thousands more under medical observation. \n A medical and humanitarian tragedy has wreaked havoc in Wuhan city and Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic. \n A widely circulated social-media article describes 11 striking mistakes China has repeated this time around. \n The most grievous failings are the government cover-ups and censorship in the early phases of the epidemic which cost the country a precious three weeks in January to fight the virus. \n The most notorious cover-up surrounded Dr Li Wenliang, the now renowned whistle-blower who drew attention to early cases of Covid-19 infection. \n The police admonished him for warning people about the virus on social media and he later died from the infection himself. \n As news of his death began to circulate online on the evening of Feb 6 Feb, there was an outpouring of mourning and anger \u2014 too much for the censors to manage. \n Dr Li is already a martyr in the eyes of his mourners. But will the present crisis tragically embodied by his death spur China to learn any real lessons? \n Leaning from history is one of the most difficult skills for humankind to master. \n German philosopher Hegel once cynically remarked that \u201cthe only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history\u201d. \n Twentieth-century American philosopher George Santayana offered a dark warning that \u201cthose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u201d. \n The value of historical learning is just as venerated in the Chinese tradition. The great 11th-century classic work of Chinese historiography Comprehensive Mirror to Aid Governance by Zi Zhi Tong Jian trawls the entirety of Chinese history up to that point for lessons in politics and governance. \n Courageous Chinese intellectuals are signing online letters calling for the authorities to respect freedom of speech, supposedly guaranteed by the country\u2019s constitution. \n They believe that if freedom of speech as an individual right were protected, voices like Dr Li\u2019s would have been heard more widely and effectively , perhaps forestalling the spread. If Dr Li\u2019s death led to real freedom of speech in China, that would be a lesson well learned. \n But there is no sign as yet of such learning taking place. No sooner had demands for freedom of expression gained traction than they too fell victim to censors. \n Information control is hardening, not loosening. Truthful depictions of the tolls of the crisis in Wuhan are condemned as rumours and swiftly deleted. \n This happened to Fang Fang, a resident of Wuhan and professional writer whose first-hand blogs of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in her city have gripped millions of readers. \n The length to which the censors have gone to eliminate dissent is extraordinary.

This is where most Chinese discussions on managing the epidemic are centred. \n Various experts are weighing in on the need for institutional reform. Unlike Western commentaries which tend to blame the authoritarian system of President Xi Jinping, Chinese scholars raise a multitude of questions beyond politics. \n These include concerns about state\u2013society relations, centre\u2013local relations and the role of social organisations (including non-governmental organisations) and professional groups. \n While the rigidity of the Chinese system and the consequent governance failure are part of their criticisms, their comments are more nuanced and fine-tuned. \n Some of these views may reach the very top of the Chinese system, but it is unclear how the leadership will learn from this crisis. \n There are likely to be plenty of technical fixes, such as those recently announced by President Xi. \n But will the learning be so deep as to inaugurate systemic governance reforms and ensure long-term progress? \n As China continues its fight against Covid-19, the best hope is that the country can learn real lessons from this crisis and prove Hegel wrong.

While it is convenient to insist that at this time it is still too early to know if SARS and its economic effects are the correct precedent to evaluate the coronavirus. \" Mo\u00ebc emphasized that \"contacts between China and the rest of the world have skyrocketed in the last 15 years and the appearance of long-scale contagion foci beyond the Gran China region would obviously change the equation.\" "}, {"content": "Coronavirus.

The Wuhan Coronavirus has not only left isolated to 46 million people who live in the blocked cities of the Chinese province of Hubei, the focus of the epidemic. After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Thursday an international health emergency, it is all of which is increasingly disconnected from the rest of the world. Numerous airlines have rushed to cancel their Chinese routes. Different countries have announced the closure of their borders for those who have been in that country in the last 14 days, including third-country nationals.\nWithin China, the situation that the 2019-NECO has created does not return. The number of infected Rounds 14,380; Mortal victims reach 304; People under observation, 163,000, of which of 19,544 is suspected that they have been infected. The positive news: the number of patients cured, 328, exceeds the deceased. The early morning of this Sunday, the Philippine Department of Health announced the death of a 44-year-old Chinese nationality because of Coronavirus.\nThe outbreak has already reached 24 countries, which accumulate more than 150 cases, including one in Spain. Only Africa and South America are still free of the virus.\nA situation that, according to the United States, justifies a statement of \"public health emergency\" in its territory. This country - the first announced the repatriation of its citizens in Wuhan after the abrupt closure of that city on day 23- will close its borders to any foreigner who does not have family ties with permanent citizens or residents of the US and who has been in China In the two weeks before arrival, the maximum incubation period.

Beijing wants to make clear that errors like the management of SARS - the epidemic similar to the current one who killed almost 800 people around the world in 2003 - will not be repeated.\n\"It is not necessary that the panic is uselessly necessary, or taking excessive measures,\" the Chinese ambassador in Geneva, Xu Chen, declared at a press conference. WHO, has underlined the diplomat, does not stop emphasizing that it has \"full confidence\" in the capacity of the second economy in the world to resolve the crisis. This UN organization does not consider it necessary to restrict travel or trade with the Asian country.\nFor this country , the closure of borders or the exit in Tropel of the foreigners of Wuhan represents a vote of non-confidence in its control measures and its health system, despite the saturation and lack of protective material that the same government has admitted. In many cases, bureaucratic obstacles have delayed hours or whole days the repatriation flights of foreigners.\nDespite this, a second plane chartered by France landed this Sunday at the Istres Air Base, in the south of the country, with 250 aliens of 30 different repatriated nationalities from Wuhan, two days after the arrival of the first 180 French citizens from The city identified as the zero zone of the coronavirus. None of the new passengers, 65 French and \"many Europeans\", said the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian, presented symptoms when approaching the flight.

Despite the numerous recommendations of medical specialists, and having already confirmed 13 cases in its territory, the Hong Kong government has so far refused to completely close the border. Yes it has suspended the ferry connections or high-speed train and reduced the number of flights to mainland China. The medical personnel unions threaten to declare themselves on strike this Monday if the head of the government, Carrie Lam, does not declare a complete closure.\nOther countries with a great economic dependence on China have been decidedly placed next to this power. Pakistan is reluctant to evacuate his university students in Wuhan, despite the appeals of the students, to show \"solidarity\" the government in Beijing. A similar argument uses the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen. At a press conference in Phnom Penh on Thursday he insisted that his nationals in China, including Wuhan, \"have to stay there to help the Chinese people fight this disease. Do not run away from the Chinese people in these difficult times. \"\nBut the measures of the United States, specifically, threaten to open a front more in the difficult relations between the two great powers, which had signed a truce in December in their commercial war that lasted almost two years.

Later, on Jan 3, he was called in and reprimanded by local police for allegedly spreading rumours online and disrupting social order. \n The commentary posted on the social media account of China's Supreme People's Court said that in retrospect, the eight Wuhan citizens should not have been punished, as what they said was not entirely false. \n \"It might have been a fortunate thing if the public had believed the 'rumours' then and started to wear masks and carry out sanitisation measures, and avoid the wild animal market,\" the commentary said. \n Dr Li told Caixin in an interview on Jan 30 that he had been worried the hospital would punish him for \"spreading rumours\" but felt relieved after the top court publicly criticised the police. \n \"I think there should be more than one voice in a healthy society, and I don't approve of using public power for excessive interference,\" Dr Li said. \n A few days after the police summons, Dr Li treated a patient who initially came in for glaucoma but later had a fever. A lung scan showed viral pneumonia. \n On Jan 12, as he felt unwell and was suspected of having contracted the virus, he was moved to an isolation ward, Dr Li told Caixin. His parents were also infected and sent to the hospital. \n On Jan 30, Dr Li said his test result had come back negative, but he remained in the isolation ward. \n He said he did not plan to go through official judicial channels to get an explanation, saying that it would be troublesome for him and the public security bureau. \n \"It's more important that people know the truth,\" Dr Li said. \"Justice is less important to me.\" \n He did take the opportunity, however, to clarify that rumours saying his medical licence was suspended were not true. \n As of Friday morning, China confirmed more than 31,000 coronavirus cases, and the epidemic's death toll had risen past 600. \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global.

Only a very tiny minority are calling for independence.\nProtests have lost their intensity this year, with many people avoiding large crowds in the densely populated financial hub due to the coronavirus outbreak which has killed two of the 69 patients in the city.\nBut the outbreak has exacerbated anger with the city\u2019s leadership and the influence of Communist Party rulers in Beijing. In particular, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam\u2019s refusal to seal the border with mainland China, seen by many as a move to appease Beijing, has infuriated many.\nLam has said a full closure of the border would be impractical, inappropriate and discriminatory and that the government\u2019s response to the crisis was based on scientific advice and had no political considerations.\nThere have been sporadic weekend protests drawing hundreds since Hong Kong reported its first patient last month, demanding full closure of the border and opposing some buildings being turned into quarantine centers. These have been largely peaceful.\nBut protesters last month torched the ground floor of one building due to be set up as a quarantine center, forcing authorities to ditch the plan.\nA Hong Kong police officer was confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus on Friday.

HONG KONG \u2014 The number of \"silent carriers\"\u00a0\u2014 people who are infected by the new coronavirus but show delayed or no symptoms\u00a0\u2014 could be as high as one-third of those who test positive, according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post. \n That could further complicate the strategies being used by countries to contain the virus, which has infected more than 280,000 people and killed nearly 13,000 globally. \n More than 43,000 people in China had tested positive for Covid-19 by the end of February but had no immediate symptoms, a condition typically known as asymptomatic, according to the data. They were placed in quarantine and monitored but were not included in the official tally of confirmed cases, which stood at about 80,000 at the time. \n Scientists have been unable to agree on what role asymptomatic transmission plays in spreading the disease. A patient usually develops symptoms in five days, though the incubation period can be as long as three weeks in some rare cases. \n One obstacle is that countries tally their confirmed cases differently. \n The World Health Organisation classifies all people who test positive as confirmed cases regardless of whether they experience any symptoms. South Korea also does this. But the Chinese government changed its classification guidelines on Feb 7, counting only those patients with symptoms as confirmed cases. The United States, Britain and Italy simply do not test people without symptoms, apart from medical workers who have prolonged exposure to the virus. \n The approach taken by China and South Korea of testing anyone who has had close contact with a patient\u00a0\u2014 regardless of whether the person has symptoms\u00a0\u2014 may explain why the two Asian countries seem to have checked the spread of the virus. Hong Kong is extending testing to airport arrivals in the city, even if travellers have no symptoms. Meanwhile in most European countries and the US, where only those with symptoms are tested, the number of infections continues to rapidly rise. \n A growing number of studies are now questioning the WHO's earlier statement that asymptomatic transmission was \"extremely rare\". A report by the WHO's international mission after a trip to China estimated that asymptomatic infections accounted for 1 to 3 per cent of cases, according to a European Union paper. \n \"The number of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) cases worldwide continues to grow, and the gap between reports from China and statistical estimates of incidence based on cases diagnosed outside China indicates that a substantial number of cases are underdiagnosed,\" a group of Japanese experts led by Mr Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido University, wrote in a letter to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases in February. \n Based on their research, Mr Nishiura put the proportion of asymptomatic Japanese patients evacuated from Wuhan , ground zero of the outbreak in China, at 30.8 per cent\u00a0\u2014 similar to the classified Chinese government data. \n But official figures from South Korea\u00a0\u2014 which had carried out nearly 300,000 tests on all close contacts of its confirmed cases as of Wednesday \u2014 are the most comparable to China's. More than 20 per cent of the asymptomatic cases reported to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention remained without symptoms until they were discharged from hospital. \n \"Korea currently has a significantly higher rate of asymptomatic cases than other countries, perhaps due to our extensive testing,\" Ms Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea's CDC, told a press briefing on March 16. \n Another useful point of reference is the data collected from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined for weeks in Yokohama, Japan.

There were 889 asymptomatic patients among the 44,672 confirmed cases as of February 11, epidemiologists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention wrote in a paper published online in JAMA Network Open on February 24. \n The WHO has said the role of asymptomatic transmissions in the spread of the disease was not clear, but carriers without symptoms were unlikely to be a key factor overall. \n However, some scientists are asking whether asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmissions have been underestimated. \n A joint study by experts in China, the US, Britain and Hong Kong estimated that undocumented cases of the pneumonia, mostly with mild or even no symptoms, were the source of infection for 79 per cent of documented ones before Wuhan was locked down on Jan 23. \n \"These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited, or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur,\" the specialists from Columbia University, the University of Hong Kong, Imperial College London, Tsinghua University, and the University of California, Davis wrote in the report. \n A separate study by scientists from the University of Texas at Austin estimated that people who had not yet developed symptoms transmitted around 10 per cent of the 450 cases they studied in 93 Chinese cities. Their findings are awaiting publication in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Ho from the University of Hong Kong said some asymptomatic patients had a viral load similar to those with symptoms. \n \"Of course it is hard to say if they may be less infectious if they don't cough. But there are also droplets when you speak,\" he said, referring to how the respiratory virus is transmitted. \n Mr Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiology and biostatistics professor at the University of Hong Kong, said there was \"clear evidence that infected persons could transmit infection before symptoms appear\". \n \"There are many reports of transmission around one to two days before symptom onset,\" he said. \n A better understanding of asymptomatic cases could lead to adjustments in public health policy, experts said. \n \"The asymptomatic ratio ... could be higher among children than in older adults,\" Mr Nishiura wrote in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. \"That would considerably change our scope of the outbreak, and even the optimal interventions can change.\" SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST "}, {"content": "Maskendiplomatie.

In the following days, further machines came with urgently needed relief supplies.

On board was also Sun Shuopeng, the Vice President of the Chinese Red Cross. On the following Thursday, he said media reports at a press conference: \"Here in Milan, the most of Covid-19 area, the Lockdown measures are very Lax. I see that public transport is still in operation, people go around, meet hotels and do not wear masks. I do not know what people think here. \"\nSuch criticism is not a typical embassy from China these days. Most parts are to hear agbing words. China's KP boss and President Xi Jingping, for example, the Spanish Premier Pedro Sanchez with the hopeful remark, \"after the storm is sunshine\". Not without adding, after the pandemic one should think about more intensive cooperation.\nIn a telephone conversation with Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Xi voice from a \"Silk Road of Health\" as part of China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative. A clear indication that the help for distressing Europeans also has a geopolitical aspect (which, of course, will no less valuable). The Chinese Silk Road Initiative is predominantly critical in Europe, as expansionism and as a way to drive the participating countries into the debt dependence of China. The picture should now brighten and forget that the Corona crisis had started with China's inactivity and veil tactics.\nThe fact that China currently drives mass production of protective masks in unexpected heights to provide the material worldwide is prominent in propaganda. \"Trump can not keep his mask promise without Chinese factories,\" tones the websites of the regime. It is even scattered that the virus comes from the US - a baffling plump response to the experiments of the American President, with formulations such as \"Chinese virus\" to instrumentalize the health disaster for nationalist purposes.\nOtherwise, China is full of humanity as a friendly great power. And that depends. For example, the Old Allied Serbia, whose President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 is quoted with the following statement: \"The European solidarity is not available. It is an ammetical tale. We set our hope into the only country that is able to get us in this difficult situation Help: The People's Republic of China. \"\nHe meets a sensitive point. Did not Germany first banned the export of respiratory protective masks to Italy, and is not it so that a few kilometers from the distressing Alsace removes German intensive care units free capacities? And what has become of America, the land of carepackets and raisin bombers?\nChina wants to take this role. Refractors, with all equal in the world. This is the \"Chinese dream of the big national Renaissance\", the solution Xi Jinpings. For millennia, such a solution is issued in China for domination periods, which should give their name to the respective era. The concept of Chinese renaissance has a century tradition, but now it should be so far under the leadership of the KP China. The Corona crisis seemed difficult to shake this course at the beginning - but now Beijing reverses the energy of this shock and wants to use it for its own rise.

The rest is \"noise,\" he says, reminding that, taking China and part of Italy, There is no limitation on travel.\nSince last weekend that there is literally panic in Europe, the number of affected countries is growing. France, Italy, now Spain, talks about many canceled flights, many customers who do not know whether or not they should keep their travels. Is alarmism or is it enough to shake the sector? It's a bit all this. It is a little panic, of ignorance of the facts, but also a little of the sector to be shaken. I have the feeling that the first thing we have to do before starting to talk about coronavirus is to get out of the \"disco\", there's a lot of noise. The media circus that is mounted around this theme has produced a huge noise and this noise has hampered the configuration, framing, relativization of any problem.\nLet's set up the problem out of the noise: what we have to date today and knowing that numbers are very dynamic. About 80,000 infected, about 2700 dead, which indicates a frankly low mortality rate, especially compared to other similar events that had higher mortality rates. We have almost 30,000 patients cured or recovered from the infection, something that the media circus never points out. This Tuesday was looking at a television that spoke of 80,000 infected, 2700 dead and nothing else. It must be added: and 30,000 recovered. And then there is to relativize and frame.\nBy year in Portugal they should die about 3 thousand people [flu], per year in Italy - where we count, at the moment we are talking, 12 dead - die about 8 thousand people in the flu. Does this mean that we have no problem? Surely no. We have to frame it.\nI understand that you want to sereno, being the president of APAVT, but Tuesday we heard a world specialist who has returned from China to say that the world is not prepared for such a thing. If the world is not prepared according to a specialist, it may be good the sector to prepare yourself. But I'm not saying that the sector is not prepared. First, I am relativizing and moving away the circus. Let's talk about numbers. This is not to say we do not have a problem. But what is the main problem for already? It is the lack of knowledge of the virus, its way of transmission, its consequences, its moment of transmission, whether seasonal or throughout the year, is unpredictability.

One analogy could be demonetisation\".\nWhile Kerala dealt with the Nipah virus effectively and India handled the quarantines of returnees from Wuhan well, \"the number of cases was small\".\nA Wuhan-sized outbreak involving tens of thousands would likely overwhelm India.\nChina has many more doctors and hospital beds relative to its population than India and is a single-party government administered by technocrats.\n\"Even the Chinese system was creaking at the seams,\" he says.\n\nIndia's high levels of pollution leave large numbers battling coughs.\nCoughs in the audience punctuate Menon's talk, and he himself was suffering from one.\nThis is an additional challenge for overloaded hospitals in India.\n\"Respiratory distress as one possible symptom of the coronavirus infection in a country that contains 18 of the 20 world's most polluted cities, isn't particularly useful,\" he wryly points out.\nAfter questions about how long a vaccine might take and whether Covid-19 came from a biological warfare lab, which Menon dismisses, the talk is wrapped up.\nMenon is surrounded by people who want the professor to play doctor.\nIs it safe to fly?

Bengaluru, however, is characterised by dust pollution that rivals Delhi's as the city's pavements and roads are dug up in a manner that suggests an earthquake has struck.\nThis has created a slow-motion crisis of recurrent coughs, asthma and lung ailments.\nWith the Covid-19 epidemic upon us, years of apathy about pollution may have handicapped India's ability to fight it.

And this number remained stable for weeks, with the authorities to try to perceive the course of the infected in Italy.\nOnly almost 20 days later, on February 22, the first case of internal contamination in a city is about 60 kilometers from Milan: the small codogno, in northern Italy, confirmed six cases of infection by the new coronavirus and decided to All public and private places, including schools, services and supermarkets.\nThe next day, the \"alarms\" sounded again: the Italian authorities confirmed two deaths by coronavirus and about six dozen of new infections, when 24 hours before there were less than ten confirmed cases. And since that day the numbers do not stop multiplying.\nThe regions of northern Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna are being the most affected by the outbreak - 85% of the infected ones are from that region, which registers about 90% of the deaths. But the virus has already been confirmed in all 20 regions of the country.\nThis Thursday, the count of the outbreak of the new coronavirus rose 250, for 1266 deaths. The total number of cases increased to 17,660, compared to 15.113 on Thursday, a rise from 16.8%. It is the largest daily rise in absolute numbers as long as the contagion accelerated.\nIn order to have evolved in such a quick way, the Italian authorities believe that the new coronavirus entered the country long before the first case has been detected, as Time Flavia Riccardo magazine, investigator of the Department of Infectious Diseases of the National Institute Health from Italy. \"All this happened exactly when we were dealing with our flu peak, when citizens had symptoms of this pathology,\" she says.\nStill before the confirmation of the first cases, there were an abnormally high number with pneumonia in a hospital in codogno and these health facilities may have become infection foci.

NEW DELHI - India could face between around 100,000 and 1.3 million confirmed cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus by mid-May if it continues to spread at its current pace, according to a team of scientists based mainly in the United States.  \n The estimates reinforce concerns among some medical officials and experts in India that the country of 1.4 billion people could see coronavirus cases jump sharply in the coming weeks and put its health system under severe strain.  \n The scientists said projections could change as the country conducts more testing, while also putting in place stricter restrictions and measures to stem the spread of the virus.  \n \"Even with the best case scenarios, probably, you are in a very painful crisis,\" said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan who was involved in the study.  \n The study was carried out by the COV-IND-19 Study Group of scholars and scientists looking into the threat posed by the coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease it causes, in India.  \n The analysis first appeared on Medium, a U.S. publishing platform, on Saturday.  \n India probably has only around 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 40,000 ventilators, said Dhruva Chaudhry, president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, based on industry estimates and other data.  \n \"We can handle it if an even number (of cases) come over a period of time,\" Chaudhry said.

The latest country after Singapore to confirm its first case is Vietnam.\u00a0 \n CONTRACT TRACING \n With the results confirmed, Mr Dolp said that the Government is aware of the identities of the four isolated hotel employees and their conditions are being monitored by the Government as well.\u00a0 \n The hotel will support MOH\u2019s efforts in contact tracing beyond the four workers, through the use of surveillance footage and so forth, he added.\u00a0 \n  Mr Josef Dolp, the executive vice-president of operations for Southeast Asia and Australasia of Shangri-La Group, said that hotel employees have been reminded to practise strict hygiene habits at all times. Photo: CNA \n In recent weeks, due to the growing threat of the virus which causes fever, pneumonia and other flu-like symptoms, Mr Dolp said that the hotel has been taking more precautionary measures. After guests have checked out, the rooms have been\u00a0thoroughly disinfected and sanitised. \n \u201cWe have increased our cleaning and sanitising frequency of guest rooms, hotel facilities and all public areas. Temperature checks are in place for our guests and colleagues.\u00a0 \n \u201cWe have also reminded our staff to practise strict hygiene habits at all times, to stay at home if they are not feeling well and to seek medical attention immediately if they believe they have some symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness,\u201d he added.\u00a0 \n Mr Dolp said that they will work with other hotel guests who might have concerns about transmission.\u00a0 \n \u201cWe will, of course, install information desks\u2026 we will address questions the guests have. We will also, if they want to move, help them to move.\u201d \n The authorities in China confirmed a few days ago that the coronavirus could be transmitted from human to human.\u00a0 \n Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people. In rare cases, they evolve and spread from human to human. \n The new virus, known as 2019-nCoV, is a strain that has not been previously identified in humans. \n It is in the same family as the ones that caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), as well as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which killed almost 800 people worldwide from 2002 to 2003, including 33 in Singapore. \n The Sars virus was transmitted from civet cats to humans and the one causing Mers was from one-hump camels to humans. \n To date, the source of the new virus has not yet been established.

SINGAPORE \u2014 China\u2019s embassy in Singapore has slammed former diplomat Bilahari Kausikan over a commentary in The Straits Times, saying that it misinterpreted and smeared China\u2019s political and leadership systems, and was no different from the stereotypical \u201ccliche of Western anti-China voices\u201d. \n The embassy said in its 589-word broadside published on its Facebook page on Tuesday (Feb 25): \u201cAll constructive comments and suggestions are welcomed, but arrogance and prejudice through coloured glasses are unacceptable. \n \u201cThis kind of arrogance and prejudice is manifested as\u2026 hostility towards anything related to China.\u201d \n The embassy added: \u201cAiming to obstruct China\u2019s sound development momentum, they attack China's political system and development model, and try to undermine China's social stability.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n Asked for his response to the Chinese embassy\u2019s criticism, Mr Bilahari, who chairs the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore, told TODAY: \u201cWhat else could they say? All Chinese diplomats are under pressure to respond to President Xi\u2019s instruction to assert China\u2019s narrative.\u201d \n He added that the embassy did not address any substantive point that he made. \n \u201cInstead, they raise arguments against points I did not make, which is quite typical. It is not something I can take seriously.\u201d \n In his commentary published on Monday, titled Coronavirus: China\u2019s inflection point and the CCP\u2019s fundamental dilemma, Mr Bilahari, a former permanent secretary at Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, described China as a Leninist state led by a vanguard party that insists on absolute control. \n The Covid-19 outbreak \u2014 which began in Wuhan, China and has since spread around the world \u2014 is a consequence of this Leninist value system. It has also dented the credibility of the Chinese Communist Party\u00a0(CCP)\u00a0with the Chinese people, Mr Bilahari said.\u00a0 \n He wrote that the CCP\u2019s legitimacy rests on economic performance and it has to confront a fundamental dilemma: The essence of a Leninist state is the party\u2019s insistence on control, yet the market \u2014 by definition \u2014 means less control. \n Mr Bilahari said that it was unclear if China would go beyond fixing the serious flaws in its healthcare system after the coronavirus crisis tails off, and deal with the fundamental challenge of finding a new balance between control and economic efficiency. \n He noted that in the long sweep of Chinese history, the times of maximum danger for ruling dynasties were when periods of internal uncertainty coincided with those of external uncertainty. \n \u201cWe may be in such a time,\u201d Mr Bilahari wrote, arguing that the CCP is nearing an \u201cinflection point\u201d and fundamental decisions \u201ccannot continue to be postponed indefinitely\u201d. \n \u2018WHETHER THE SHOE FITS OR NOT, ONLY THE WEARER KNOWS\u2019 \n In its Facebook post, the Chinese embassy said that at a time when China is \u201cmaking enormous efforts and sacrifices\u201d to fight the virus outbreak , Mr Bilahari\u2019s sense of justice to \u201cideologically denigrate China and sell his long-held prejudice and even hostility towards China has to be questioned\u201d. \n \u201cWhether the shoe fits or not, only the wearer knows. \n \u201cWhether a country's development path is right or not only depends on whether it is in line with the country's reality,\u201d\u00a0the embassy said. \n The embassy also set out a series of feats that China has achieved in the last seven decades, including rising to become the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and lifting more than 800 million people out of poverty. \n \u201cSuch achievements, unique in human history, have been made under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and under the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics. \n \u201cIt has not only benefited the Chinese people, but also brought abundant opportunities to the prosperity and development for the rest of the world,\u201d\u00a0the embassy stated. \n It added that China\u2019s political system and development path have effectively solved the principal social contradictions and problems across different periods of China\u2019s growth. \n \u201cThough Mr Bilahari himself did not deny China's great achievements, he still criticised the political system and the leadership system that created them,\u201d the embassy said. \n \u201cActually, it is logically self-contradictory.\u201d \n The embassy said that China\u2019s firm commitment to upholding the CCP and its central committee, with Chinese President Xi Jinping at its core, would not waver. \n It reiterated: \u201cFacts have proved and will continue to prove that nothing can derogate the advantages of the socialism with Chinese characteristics.\u201d \n The embassy also stressed that Mr Xi, who is the general secretary of the CCP, is in \u201cfull command\u201d and the country is united in fighting the coronavirus epidemic, which it called \u201cthe enemy to all mankind\u201d. \n The embassy added: \u201cMr Bilahari put the blame of the outbreak on China's political system. Then regarding\u2026 the H1N1 flu that originated in North America and spread worldwide, which one should be blamed? \n \u201cAt the moment, what the world needs most is unity and trust, not the political virus that keeps people at bay.\u201d "}, {"content": "Chinese virus pushes handbags for red.

If previous outbreaks of coronavirus are any indication, the Wuhan strain that is now spreading may eventually be traced back to bats. \n Dr Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, who has been working in China for 15 years, studying diseases that jump from animals to people, said: \"We don't know the source yet, but there's pretty strong evidence that this is a bat-origin coronavirus.\" \n \"It's probably going to be the Chinese horseshoe bat,\" he added, referring to a common species that weighs up to 28g. \n If he is right, this strain will join many other viruses that bats carry. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics were caused by bat coronaviruses, as was a highly destructive viral epidemic in pigs. One bat can host many different viruses without getting sick. \n They are the natural reservoir for the Marburg virus, and Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have caused human disease and outbreaks in Africa, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Australia. \n They are thought to be the natural reservoir for the Ebola virus. They also carry the rabies virus, but in that case the bats are affected by the disease. Their tolerance of viruses, which surpasses that of other mammals, is one of their many distinctive qualities. \n They are the only flying mammals, they devour disease-carrying insects by the ton, and they are essential in the pollination of many fruits, like bananas, avocados and mangoes. They are also an incredibly diverse group, making up about a quarter of all mammalian species. \n But their ability to coexist with viruses that can spill over to other animals, in particular humans, can have devastating consequences when we eat them, trade them in livestock markets and invade their territory. \n Learning how they carry and survive so many viruses has been a deep question for science, and new research suggests that the answer may be how the bats' evolutionary adaptations to flight changed their immune systems. \n In a 2018 paper in Cell Host And Microbe, scientists in China and Singapore reported their investigation of how bats handle something called DNA sensing. \n The energy demands of flight are so great that cells in the body break down and release bits of DNA that are then floating around where they should not be. Mammals, including bats, have ways to identify and respond to such bits of DNA, which might indicate an invasion of a disease-causing organism. \n But in bats, the scientists found, evolution has weakened that system, which would normally cause inflammation as it fought the viruses. \n Bats have lost some genes involved in that response, which makes sense because the inflammation itself can be very damaging to the body. They have a weakened response, but it is still there. \n Thus, the researchers write, this weakened response may allow them to maintain a \"balanced state of 'effective response' but not 'over response' against viruses\". \n How to manage and contain the current outbreak of the virus officially known as nCoV-2019 is , of course, of paramount importance now. But tracing its origin and taking action to combat further outbreaks may depend partly on knowledge and monitoring of bats. \n \"The outbreak can be contained and controlled,\" Dr Daszak said. \"But if we don't know the origin in the long term, then this virus can continue to spill over.\" \n Scientists in China were already studying the bats carefully, well aware that an outbreak like the current one would most likely happen. \n In the spring, in an article on bat coronaviruses, or CoVs, a group of Chinese researchers wrote that \"it is generally believed that bat-borne CoVs will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak.\" \n They added: \"In this regard, China is a likely hot spot.\" \n This was not clairvoyance, but conventional wisdom. \n Certainly rodents, primates and birds also carry diseases that can and have jumped to people; bats are far from alone in that regard. \n But there are reasons they have been implicated in several disease outbreaks and are likely to be implicated in more. They are numerous and widespread. While bats account for a quarter of mammalian species, rodents are 50 per cent, and then there is the rest of us. \n Bats live on every continent except Antarctica, in proximity to humans and farms. The ability to fly makes them wide-ranging, which helps in spreading viruses, and their faeces can spread disease. \n People in many parts of the world eat bats and sell them in live animal markets, which was the source of Sars and possibly the latest coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan. \n Bats also often live in huge colonies in caves, where crowded conditions are ideal for passing viruses to one another. \n In a 2017 report in Nature, Dr Daszak, Dr Kevin J. Olival and other colleagues from EcoHealth Alliance reported that they had created a database of 754 mammal species and 586 viral species, and analysed which viruses were harboured by which mammals and how they affected their hosts. \n They confirmed what scientists had thought: \"Bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than all other mammalian orders.\" Zoonoses are diseases that spill over from animals to humans. \n And they do not just survive the viruses they harbour. Bats are remarkably long-lived for small mammals. The big brown bat, a common species in the United States, can live nearly 20 years in the wild. \n Others live closer to 40. One tiny bat in Siberia lived at least 41 years. Animals like house mice live about two years on average. \n While the bats must be studied, their physiology understood, and the viruses they harbour monitored for the sake of public health, that does not mean that the bats are to blame for the outbreak. \n As others have pointed out, humans have encroached on the lives of bats, not vice versa. \n Dr Daszak stressed that stopping the sale of wildlife in markets is essential to curtail future outbreaks. But since such outbreaks are inevitable, he says, monitoring and studying wildlife, like bats, is equally important. \n He compared the situation to terrorism.

Coronavirus is transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected and aerosol secretions in therapeutic procedures that produce them, refers to DGs. But how long does it persist on surfaces and how can it be inactivated? Two teachers from the Greifswald University Hospital, Germany, tried to answer these issues.\nTo find answers, they analyzed studies on the CORONV\u00cdRUS SARS and MERS. It was verified that these viruses could persist on surfaces and remain infectious at room temperature, on average, between four and five days. \"Low temperatures and a high humidity in the air further increases your life time,\" says G\u00fcnter Kampf in a statement from her institution.\nRegarding the inactivation of the various coronaviruses, in tests with disinfectant solutions, it was found that agents with ethanol, the vulgar oxygenated water or sodium hypochlorite were effective against coronavirus. If these agents were applied at appropriate concentrations, they would reduce the pathogenic particles of a million to 100 in about one minute. For researchers, these results may be extrapolated to the new coronavirus. \"We analyzed different coronaviruses and the results were similar,\" says Eike Steinmann.\nThis Tuesday and Wednesday, Scientists, Public Health Agency Professionals, Health Ministers and Research Financers will be reunited in Geneva (Switzerland) to define priorities in research and development of drugs, diagnoses and vaccines for coronavirus.

BANGKOK - Thailand's central bank cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to a record low of 0.75% on Friday as the spread of the coronavirus exerted further pressure on the flagging economy.  \n The Bank of Thailand's monetary policy committee (MPC), in a special meeting, voted unanimously to lower the one-day repurchase rate <THCBIR=ECI> in a back-to-back cut this year.  \n The rate cut was the fourth since August. Friday's special meeting was the first time since 2003.  \n \"This will mitigate the impact on the economy and also reinforce fiscal measures already implemented and forthcoming,\" the BOT said in a statement.  \n That will also reduce the burden of interest on borrowers affected by the coronavirus outbreak and alleviate strains on liquidity in the financial markets, it said.  \n \"The committee viewed that the COVID-19 outbreak in the period ahead would be more severe than previously expected and the situation would take some time before returning to normal. This would severely affect the Thai economy,\" it added.  \n The pandemic has roiled global financial markets, affecting liquidity and the functioning of Thai financial markets despite the overall stability of the financial system, it said.  \n The rate cut suggests the MPC is accepting that the Thai economy is entering a recession along with the global economy, said Amonthep Chawla, an economist at CIMB Thai.  \n (GRAPHIC: Thai GDP and regional peers - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2187/2155/Thai%20GDP%20VS%20regional%20peers.png)  \n Central banks around the world have slashed interest rates in the past few weeks and provided additional stimulus in some cases to try to help alleviate the threat to the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic.  \n Thailand on Friday reported 50 new coronavirus infections, taking its tally to 322. One person has died.  \n \"We now see two further policy rate cuts of 25 bps each in Q2 and Q3, taking the rate to a record-low 0.25% at end-2020,\" said Tim Leelahaphan, an economist at Standard Chartered.  \n \"Policy space is running out, and alternatives have not been communicated,\" he said.  \n The MPC will still meet to review policy on March 25, as scheduled, when it will also offer updated economic forecasts.  \n It is expected to slash its 2020 growth forecast from 2.8%. Some economists predict negative growth for Thailand this year.  \n Thailand is considered one of the economies most vulnerable to the virus in Southeast Asia due to its heavy reliance on Chinese tourists and China trade. Foreign receipts accounted for about 11% of Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP) last year.  \n Tourist numbers may fall by 25% this year as a result of the pandemic, the Tourism Authority of Thailand said.  \n Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded just 2.4% last year, the lowest in five years.  \n For the full text, click on https://www.bot.or.th/English/PressandSpeeches/Press/2020/Pages/n1463.aspx REUTERS "}, {"content": "drugmakers see long road ahead in coronavirus vaccine race. Drugmakers racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go.  \n That runs counter to reports of a supposed \"breakthrough\" that on Wednesday boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality.  \n At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading contagion.  \n Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as $800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort.  \n \"It will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit,\" said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's <GSK.L> vaccine unit. GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent.  \n The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm.  \n To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc <GILD.O>, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment.  \n \"There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey.  \n Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged.  \n Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola.  \n  \n 'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET'  \n Dr. Thomas Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest.  \n What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm.  \n \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,\" Frieden said.  \n A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus , while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine.  \n Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets.  \n \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,\" said World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \"drug breakthroughs.\"  \n Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months.  \n Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by Moderna Inc <MRNA.O>, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus.  \n Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate.  \n He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus.  \n Novavax Inc <NVAX.O> research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus.  \n But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments.  \n In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population.  \n \"The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" Fauci said.  \n Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question.  \n \"The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note.  \n The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around $800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc <INO.O>, Moderna Inc <MRNA.O> and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines.  \n \"We stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's <JNJ.N> chief scientific officer. \"We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\" REUTERS "}, {"content": "League and players union create monitoring commission to coronavirus pandemic.
